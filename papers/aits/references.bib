abstract = {The study of disaster events and their impact in the ur-ban space has been traditionally conducted through manual collections and analysis of surveys, questionnaires and au-thority documents. While there have been increasingly rich troves of human behavioral data related to the events of interest, the ability to obtain hindsight following a disas-ter event has not been scaled up. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel approach for analyzing events called PairFac. PairFac utilizes discriminant tensor analysis to automati-cally discover the impact of a major event from rich human behavioral data. Our method aims to (i) uncover the persis-tent patterns across multiple interrelated aspects of urban behavior (e.g., when, where and what citizens do in a city) and at the same time (ii) identify the salient changes follow-ing a potentially impactful event. We show the effectiveness of PairFac in comparison with previous methods through extensive experiments. We also demonstrate the advantages of our approach through case studies with real-world traffic sensor data and social media streams surrounding the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Our work has both methodological contributions in studying the impact of an external stimulus on a system as well as practical implications in the area of disaster event analysis and assessment.},

This paper presents a people-centric platform, Janayuja, that can act as an effective conduit between residents and civic agencies, by collecting timely information from different online sources and providing actionable insights to the agencies on pressing city issues. In particular, we elaborate on four major components of the platform: (i) curation of reports from heterogeneous data sources; (ii) categorization of individual reports into relevant issues (e.g. bus breakdown) using suitable classification techniques; (iii) aggregation of related reports (in the spatio- temporal sense) to identify specific issues pivoted to distinct city locations; and (iv) verification of issues to ensure reliability of information being provided to the agencies. Janayuja is deployed for the largest public transport agency in Bangalore, India. Based on insights generated by Janayuja, the agency can better manage their current operations, understand and anticipate new requirements from commuters (e.g. for new bus routes) and, in turn, encourage greater usage of a public transportation system.},

abstract = {Cities are composed of complex systems with physical, cyber, and social components. Current works on ex-tracting and understanding city events mainly rely on technology enabled infrastructure to observe and record events. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage citizen observations of various city systems and services such as traffic, public transport, water supply, weather, sewage, and public safety as a source of city events. We investigate the feasibility of using such textual streams for extracting city events from annotated text. We formalize the problem of annotating social streams such as microblogs as a sequence labeling problem. We present a novel training data creation process for training sequence labeling models. Our automatic training data creation process utilizes instance level domain knowledge (e.g., locations in a city, possible event terms). We compare this automated annotation process to a state-of-the-art tool that needs manually created training data and show that it has comparable performance in annotation tasks. An aggregation algorithm is then presented for event extraction from annotated text. We carry out a com-prehensive evaluation of the event annotation and event extraction on a real-world dataset consisting of event reports and tweets collected over four months from San Francisco Bay Area. The evaluation results are promising and provide insights into the utility of social stream for extracting city events.},

First, we constructed and released a large-scale multi-source multi-modal dataset from three geographical areas. We then applied our proposed ensemble model on this dataset to learn user profile.

@article{Chen2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.Bike sharing is booming globally as a green transportation mode, but the occurrence of over-demand stations that have no bikes or docks available greatly affects user experiences. Directly predicting individual over-demand stations to carry out preventive measures is difficult, since the bike usage pattern of a station is highly dynamic and context dependent. In addition, the fact that bike usage pattern is affected not only by common contextual factors (e.g., time and weather) but also by opportunistic contextual factors (e.g., social and traffic events) poses a great challenge. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic cluster-based framework for over-demand prediction. Depending on the context, we construct a weighted correlation network to model the relationship among bike stations, and dynamically group neighboring stations with similar bike usage patterns into clusters. We then adopt Monte Carlo simulation to predict the over-demand probability of each cluster. Evaluation results using real-world data from New York City and Washington, D.C. show that our framework accurately predicts over-demand clusters and outperforms the baseline methods significantly.},

@article{Abbasi2015,
abstract = {A growing body of literature has been devoted to harnessing the crowdsourcing power of social media by extracting knowledge from the huge amounts of information available online. This paper discusses how social media data can be used indirectly and with minimal cost to extract travel attributes such as trip purpose and activity location. As a result, the capacity of Twitter data in complementing other sources of transport related data such as household travel surveys or traffic count data is examined. Further, a detailed discussion is provided on how short term travellers, such as tourists, can be identified using Twitter data and how their travel pattern can be analysed. Having appropriate information about tourists/visitors – such as the places they visit, their origin and the pattern of their movements at their destination – is of great importance to urban planners. The available profile information of users and self-reported geo-location data on Twitter are used to identify tourists visiting Sydney as well as also those Sydney residents who made a trip outside Sydney. The presented data and analysis enable us to understand and track tourists' movements in cities for better urban planning. The results of this paper open up avenues for travel demand modellers to explore the possibility of using big data (in this case Twitter data) to model short distance (day-to-day or activity based) and long distance (vacation) trips.},

The increasing amount of user-generated data associated with the rise of social media emphasizes the need for methods to deal with the uncertainty inherent to these data sources. In this paper we address one aspect of uncertainty by developing a new methodology to establish the reliability of user-generated data based upon causal links with recurring patterns. We associate a large data set of geo-tagged Twitter messages in San Francisco with points of interest, such as bars, restaurants, or museums, within the city. This model is validated by causal relationships between a point of interest and the amount of messages in its vicinity. We subsequently analyze the behavior of these messages over time using a jackknifing procedure to identify categories of points of interest that exhibit consistent patterns over time. Ultimately, we condense this analysis into an indicator that gives evidence on the certainty of a data set based on these causal relationships and recurring patterns in temporal and spatial dimensions.},

We correlated observed tweet patterns with official census data for the case study of London in order to underline the significance and reliability of Twitter data.

The drivers' and riders' lack of options to change or compute the path according to their own preferences and requirements is problematic. With the advancement of mobile social networking technologies, it is necessary to reconsider the principles and desired characteristics of ride-sharing systems. In this paper, we formalized the ride-sharing problem as a multi source-destination path planning problem. An objective function that models different objectives in a unified framework was developed. Moreover, we provide a similarity model, which can reflect the personal preferences of the rides and utilize social media to obtain the current interests of the riders and drivers. The model also allows each driver to generate sub-optimal paths according to his own requirements by suitably adjusting the weights. Two case studies have shown that our system has the potential to find the best possible match and computes the multiple optimal paths against different user-defined objective functions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Information flow plays a central role in the development of transport policy, transport planning and the effective operation of the transport system. The recent upsurge in web enabled and pervasive technologies offer the opportunity of a new route for dynamic information flow that captures the views, needs and experiences of the travelling public in a timely and direct fashion through social media text posts. To date there is little published research, however, on how to realize this opportunity for the sector by capturing and analysing the text data.This paper provides an overview of the different categories of social media, the characteristics of its content and how these characteristics are reflected in transport-related posts. The research described in this paper includes a formulation of the goals for harvesting transport-related information from social media, the hypotheses to be tested to demonstrate that such information can provide valuable input to transport policy development or delivery and the challenges this involves.A hierarchical approach for categorizing transport-related information harvested from social media is presented. An explanatory study was designed, based on the understanding of the nature of social media content, the goals in harvesting it for transport planning and management purposes and existing text mining techniques. An exploratory case study is used to illustrate the process based on Twitter posts associated with particular UK sporting fixtures (i.e. football matches).The results demonstrate both the volume and pertinence of the information obtained. Whilst text-mining techniques have been applied in a number of other sectors (notably entertainment, business and the political arena), the use of information in the transport sector has some unique features that stem from both day-to-day operational practices and the longer term decision making processes surrounding the transport system - hence the significance and novelty of the results reported here. Many challenges in refining the methodology and techniques remain for future research, however the outcomes presented here are of relevance to a wide range of stakeholders in the transport and text mining fields. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The lack of personalized solutions for managing the demand of joint leisure trips in cities in real time hinders the optimization of transportation system operations. Joint leisure activities can account for up to 60{\%} of trips in cities and unlike fixed trips (i.e., trips to work where the arrival time and the trip destination are predefined), leisure activities offer more optimization flexibility since the activity destination and the arrival times of individuals can vary.To address this problem, a perceived utility model derived from non-traditional data such as smartphones/social media for representing users' willingness to travel a certain distance for participating in leisure activities at different times of day is presented. Then, a stochastic annealing search method for addressing the exponential complexity optimization problem is introduced. The stochastic annealing method suggests the preferred location of a joint leisure activity and the arrival times of individuals based on the users' preferences derived from the perceived utility model. Test-case implementations of the approach used 14-month social media data from London and showcased an increase of up to 3 times at individuals' satisfaction while the computational complexity is reduced to almost linear time serving the real-time implementation requirements.},

In this paper, a utility maximization model for capturing automatically users' willingness to travel a certain distance for participating in different activity types based on user-generated data is introduced. The model is based on Big-Data analytics on user-generated data from Social Media that can offer valuable insights into users' preferences and improve our understanding on their decision-making mechanisms for selecting joint activities. Unlike static approaches, the utility model of each agent is developed to incorporate continuously updated data feeds regarding agents' activities (i.e., timing of visiting a POI, type of POI). The agent-utility model is implemented and tested via utilizing geo-tagged, social media data from 65 individuals from the dense city of London (crawling campaign from November 2012-January 2014). After implementing the utility-maximization model, all users are clustered based on their willingness to travel similar distances to participate in certain types of activities, facilitating the development of applications for suggesting joint activities among agents with similar profiles.},

abstract = {Location-based check-in services in various social media applications have enabled individuals to share their activity-related choices providing a new source of human activity data. Although geo-location data has the potential to infer multi-day patterns of individual activities, appropriate methodological approaches are needed. This paper presents a technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns of users' weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities (a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information. This work provides foundational tools that can be used when geo-location data is available to predict disaggregate activity patterns. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper geolocation (or spatial) based information provided in social media is investigated to utilize intelligent transportation services. Further, the general trend of travel activities during weekdays is studied. For this purpose, a dataset consisting of more than 40,000 tweets in south and west part of the Sydney metropolitan area is utilized. After a data processing effort, the tweets are clustered into seven main categories using text mining techniques, where each category represents a type of activity including shopping, recreation, and work. Unlike the previous studies in this area, the focus of this work is on the content of the tweets rather than only using geotagged data or sentiment analysis. Beside activity type, temporal and spatial distributions of activities are used in the classification exercise. Categories are mapped to the identified regions within the city of Sydney across four time slots (two peak periods and two off-peak periods). Each time slot is used to construct a network with nodes represnting people, activities and locations and edges reflecting the association between the nodes. The constructed networks are used to study the trend of activities/locations in a typical working day. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

Location-based user generated data could be an exceptionally rich source of informa- tion about events, however the vastness and the heterogeneity of such information makes it almost impossible for city managers to have a comprehensive view. Some events are planned and advertised only among restricted communities, for many it is problematic to estimate the number of attendees, and in general it is very difficult to have information about citizen mobility in areas nearby or where events happen. In this paper, we describe EXSED, an interactive intelligent tool to support the visual exploration of social events dynamics along the spatial, temporal and organizational dimensions. Major functionalities include: (i) studying events that are either officially/unofficially planned and with global/local scope; (ii) extract discussion topics for an event and investigate their temporal and spatial profile; (iii) estimate event attendees and correlate their mobility patterns with the event evolution. We present preliminary results of a field study with officials from Dublin City Council (Ireland), who evaluated our tool on real world user-generated tweeter data and events in the city.},

abstract = {— Subway passenger flow prediction is strategically important in metro transit system management. The prediction under event occurrences turns into a very challenging task. In this paper, we adopt a new kind of data source—social media— to tackle this challenge. We develop a systematic approach to examine social media activities and sense event occurrences. Our initial analysis demonstrates that there exists a moderate positive correlation between passenger flow and the rates of social media posts. This finding motivates us to develop a novel approach for improved flow forecast. We first develop a hashtag-based event detection algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a parametric and convex optimization-based approach, called optimization and prediction with hybrid loss function (OPL), to fuse the linear regression and the results of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model jointly. The OPL hybrid model takes advantage of the unique strengths of linear correlation in social media features and SARIMA model in time series prediction. Experiments on events nearby a subway station show that OPL reports the best forecasting performance compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. In addition, an ensemble model is developed to leverage the weighted results from OPL and support vector machine regression together. As a result, the prediction accuracy and the robustness further increase.},

Due to the widespread popularity of mobile devices with location-aware capabilities and the extensive prevalence of location-based social networks, citizens' movements and their trajectories are being produced and gathered at an unprecedented rate. In this context, there are two fundamental issues that need to be addressed: trajectory data hold private information of citizens that require privacy preserving solutions for data release and analysis, and the heterogeneous nature of the trajectory data makes it hard to effectively measure their similarity, which is fundamental to trajectory analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing an innovative private trajectories calibration model that not only guarantees the privacy of citizens, but also increases the utility. We have conducted comprehensive experiments using real-life user trajectories extracted from Twitter data.

abstract = {The demographics and landscape of cities are changing rapidly, and there is an emphasis to better understand the factors which influence citizen happiness in order to design smarter urban systems. Few studies have attempted to understand how large-scale sentiment maps to urban human geography. Inferring sentiment from social media data is one such scalable solution. In this paper, we apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to 0.4 million geo-tagged Tweets in the Greater London area to understand the influence of socioeconomic and urban geography parameters on happiness. Our results not only verify established thinking: that job opportunities correlate with positive sentiments; but also reveal two insights: (1) happiness is negatively correlated with number of children, and (2) happiness has a U-shaped (parabolic) relationship with access to public transportation. The latter implies that the happiest people are those who have good access to public transport, or such poor access that they use private transportation. The number of jobs, children, and transportation availability are every day facets of urban living and individually account for up to 47{\%} of the variations in people's happiness. Our results show that they influence happiness more significantly than long term socioeconomic parameters such as degradation, education, income, housing, and crime. This study will enable urban planners and system designers to move beyond the traditional cost-benefit methodology and to incorporate citizens' happiness. {\&}copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {This article discusses the background, nature and application of the concept of ubiquitous city, presenting u-city initiatives of affluent and techno-savvy cities in Asia and the West with special reference to the case of South Korea. The focus is on how ubiquitous technologies have been and can be utilised in developing urban infrastructure, including town planning, street and property maintenance, water supply, public transportation and environmental protection. Such an emerging infrastructure is expected to provide everyone with an opportunity to access urban infrastructure and services with the help of ubiquitous technologies. However, in order to become reality, this requires some kind of democratisation of technology, which is a neglected topic in u-city discourse. It is also important to analyse u-city developments from the point of view of production of space with special reference to the potential colonisation of everyday life. Theoretically speaking, one answer to such compelling questions about the rationale of u-city development can be sought from the idea of the ‘right to the city', a slogan originally coined by Henri Lefebvre. This approach highlights the importance of involving people to envisioning the future of urban form starting from the perspective of their everyday life. Such a dimension should be given more prominent role in current u-city developments.},

@article{Nelson2013,
abstract = {The emergence of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) has been recognised with many initiatives during the last 20 years. In Europe, the " ITS Action Plan" identifies a number of applications as key elements contributing to the efficient co-ordination of the overall transport chain. The context and experience surrounding the recent widespread development of technological tools and ICT platforms to support the emergence of ITS are notable for the way in which they permeate the transport and logistics chain. But a key question remains: to what extent is the public transport sector able to exploit the wider benefits of ITS?This paper provides a comparative analysis of ITS policy between Europe and Australia. With a focus on the applications and methods adopted in the use of ITS in the public transport sector in Australia the paper critiques their effectiveness in enhancing passenger experience, operator effectiveness and the likely effect on patronage. The relatively low incidence of the use of ITS in the public transport system in Australia, as compared to Europe, is discussed in the context of technology trends/pathways and impediments to deployment in the public transport sector. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present in this paper our winning solution to Dedicated Task 1 in Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC). MDC Task 1 is to infer the semantic category of a place based on the smartphone sensing data obtained at that place. We approach this task in a standard supervised learning setting: we extract discriminative features from the sensor data and use state-of-the-art classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Family) to build classification models. We have found that feature engineering, or in other words, constructing features using human heuristics, is very effective for this task. In particular, we have proposed a novel feature engineering technique, Conditional Feature (CF), a general framework for domain-specific feature construction. In total, we have generated 2,796,200 features and in our final five submissions we use feature selection to select 100 to 2000 features. One of our key findings is that features conditioned on fine-granularity time intervals, e.g. every 30 min, are most effective. Our best 10-fold CV accuracy on training set is 75.1{\%} by Gradient Boosted Trees, and the second best accuracy is 74.6{\%} by L1-regularized Logistic Regression. Besides the good performance, we also report briefly our experience of using F{\#} language for large-scale (???70 GB raw text data) conditional feature construction. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Ahvenniemi2017,
abstract = {City assessment tools can be used as support for decision making in urban development as they provide assessment methodologies for cities to show the progress towards defined targets. In the 21st century, there has been a shift from sustainability assessment to smart city goals. We analyze 16 sets of city assessment frameworks (eight smart city and eight urban sustainability assessment frameworks) comprising 958 indicators altogether by dividing the indicators under three impact categories and 12 sectors. The following main observations derive from the analyses: as expected, there is a much stronger focus on modern technologies and “smartness” in the smart city frameworks compared to urban sustainability frameworks. Another observation is that as urban sustainability frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring environmental sustainability, smart city frameworks lack environmental indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects. A general goal of smart cities is to improve sustainability with help of technologies. Thus, we recommend the use of a more accurate term “smart sustainable cities” instead of smart cities. However, the current large gap between smart city and sustainable city frameworks suggest that there is a need for developing smart city frameworks further or re-defining the smart city concept. We recommend that the assessment of smart city performance should not only use output indicators that measure the efficiency of deployment of smart solutions but also impact indicators that measure the contribution towards the ultimate goals such as environmental, economic or social sustainability.},

@article{Kummitha2017,
abstract = {Smart city approaches in city planning have gained significant momentum in the recent past. While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings'.},
