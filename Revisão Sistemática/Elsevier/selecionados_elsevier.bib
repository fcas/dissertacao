abstract = {This paper proposes a social media content mining framework that consists of seven phases. The framework was tested empirically during the FIFA World Cup 2014 at Curitiba (Brazil) as one of the main host city destinations. The research focused on the mining of Twitter content with tourist services ontology (hospitality, food and beverages, and transportation). In total, 58,686 valid messages were collected, analyzed, and associated with an application ontology. Content analysis demonstrated an accurate real-time reflection of tourism services. The framework is effective to collect relevant content and identify popular topics in social media toward strategic and operational tourism management.},

abstract = {The lack of personalized solutions for managing the demand of joint leisure trips in cities in real time hinders the optimization of transportation system operations. Joint leisure activities can account for up to 60{\%} of trips in cities and unlike fixed trips (i.e., trips to work where the arrival time and the trip destination are predefined), leisure activities offer more optimization flexibility since the activity destination and the arrival times of individuals can vary.To address this problem, a perceived utility model derived from non-traditional data such as smartphones/social media for representing users' willingness to travel a certain distance for participating in leisure activities at different times of day is presented. Then, a stochastic annealing search method for addressing the exponential complexity optimization problem is introduced. The stochastic annealing method suggests the preferred location of a joint leisure activity and the arrival times of individuals based on the users' preferences derived from the perceived utility model. Test-case implementations of the approach used 14-month social media data from London and showcased an increase of up to 3 times at individuals' satisfaction while the computational complexity is reduced to almost linear time serving the real-time implementation requirements.},

This paper describes an approach to analyze geotagged social media data from Twitter to characterize spatial, temporal and demographic features of tourist flows in Cilento - a regional tourist attraction in southern Italy. It demonstrates how the analysis of geotagged social media data yields more detailed spatial, temporal and demographic information of tourist movements, in comparison to the current understanding of tourist flows in the region. The insights obtained from our case study illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology yet attention should be paid to biases in the data as well as methodological limitations when drawing conclusions from analytical results.},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge regarding the whereabouts of people and their social activities in urban areas with high spatial and temporal resolution is still widely unexplored. Thus, the spatiotemporal analysis of Location Based Social Networks (LBSN) has great potential regarding the ability to sense spatial processes and to gain knowledge about urban dynamics, especially with respect to collective human mobility behavior. The objective of this paper is to explore the semantic association between georeferenced tweets and their respective spatiotemporal whereabouts. We apply a semantic topic model classification and spatial autocorrelation analysis to detect tweets indicating specific human social activities. We correlated observed tweet patterns with official census data for the case study of London in order to underline the significance and reliability of Twitter data. Our empirical results of semantic and spatiotemporal clustered tweets show an overall strong positive correlation in comparison with workplace population census data, being a good indicator and representative proxy for analyzing workplace-based activities.},

abstract = {Dense cities with complex transport infrastructure and numerous Places of Interest (POIs) pose challenges to interpersonal interactions since the location and the time of conducting a joint activity are rarely agreed unanimously from all agents, mainly due to lack of information of each agent's schedule and activity preferences. In this paper, a utility maximization model for capturing automatically users' willingness to travel a certain distance for participating in different activity types based on user-generated data is introduced. The model is based on Big-Data analytics on user-generated data from Social Media that can offer valuable insights into users' preferences and improve our understanding on their decision-making mechanisms for selecting joint activities. Unlike static approaches, the utility model of each agent is developed to incorporate continuously updated data feeds regarding agents' activities (i.e., timing of visiting a POI, type of POI). The agent-utility model is implemented and tested via utilizing geo-tagged, social media data from 65 individuals from the dense city of London (crawling campaign from November 2012-January 2014). After implementing the utility-maximization model, all users are clustered based on their willingness to travel similar distances to participate in certain types of activities, facilitating the development of applications for suggesting joint activities among agents with similar profiles.},

abstract = {Location-based check-in services in various social media applications have enabled individuals to share their activity-related choices providing a new source of human activity data. Although geo-location data has the potential to infer multi-day patterns of individual activities, appropriate methodological approaches are needed. This paper presents a technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns of users' weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities (a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information. This work provides foundational tools that can be used when geo-location data is available to predict disaggregate activity patterns. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this context, Twitter has become an important sensor of the interactions between individuals and their environment. Building on this idea, this paper proposes the use of geolocated tweets as a complementary source of information for urban planning applications, focusing on the characterization of land use. The proposed technique uses unsupervised learning and automatically determines land uses in urban areas by clustering geographical regions with similar tweeting activity patterns. Three case studies are presented and validated for Manhattan (NYC), London (UK) and Madrid (Spain) using Twitter activity and land use information provided by the city planning departments. Results indicate that geolocated tweets can be used as a powerful data source for urban planning applications. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Information flow plays a central role in the development of transport policy, transport planning and the effective operation of the transport system. The recent upsurge in web enabled and pervasive technologies offer the opportunity of a new route for dynamic information flow that captures the views, needs and experiences of the travelling public in a timely and direct fashion through social media text posts. To date there is little published research, however, on how to realize this opportunity for the sector by capturing and analysing the text data.This paper provides an overview of the different categories of social media, the characteristics of its content and how these characteristics are reflected in transport-related posts. The research described in this paper includes a formulation of the goals for harvesting transport-related information from social media, the hypotheses to be tested to demonstrate that such information can provide valuable input to transport policy development or delivery and the challenges this involves.A hierarchical approach for categorizing transport-related information harvested from social media is presented. An explanatory study was designed, based on the understanding of the nature of social media content, the goals in harvesting it for transport planning and management purposes and existing text mining techniques. An exploratory case study is used to illustrate the process based on Twitter posts associated with particular UK sporting fixtures (i.e. football matches).The results demonstrate both the volume and pertinence of the information obtained. Whilst text-mining techniques have been applied in a number of other sectors (notably entertainment, business and the political arena), the use of information in the transport sector has some unique features that stem from both day-to-day operational practices and the longer term decision making processes surrounding the transport system - hence the significance and novelty of the results reported here. Many challenges in refining the methodology and techniques remain for future research, however the outcomes presented here are of relevance to a wide range of stakeholders in the transport and text mining fields. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
