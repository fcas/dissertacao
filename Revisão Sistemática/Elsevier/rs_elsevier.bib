The framework was tested empirically during the FIFA World Cup 2014 at Curitiba (Brazil) as one of the main host city destinations. The research focused on the mining of Twitter content with tourist services ontology (hospitality, food and beverages, and transportation). In total, 58,686 valid messages were collected, analyzed, and associated with an application ontology. Content analysis demonstrated an accurate real-time reflection of tourism services. The framework is effective to collect relevant content and identify popular topics in social media toward strategic and operational tourism management.},

abstract = {The lack of personalized solutions for managing the demand of joint leisure trips in cities in real time hinders the optimization of transportation system operations. Joint leisure activities can account for up to 60{\%} of trips in cities and unlike fixed trips (i.e., trips to work where the arrival time and the trip destination are predefined), leisure activities offer more optimization flexibility since the activity destination and the arrival times of individuals can vary.To address this problem, a perceived utility model derived from non-traditional data such as smartphones/social media for representing users' willingness to travel a certain distance for participating in leisure activities at different times of day is presented. Then, a stochastic annealing search method for addressing the exponential complexity optimization problem is introduced. The stochastic annealing method suggests the preferred location of a joint leisure activity and the arrival times of individuals based on the users' preferences derived from the perceived utility model. Test-case implementations of the approach used 14-month social media data from London and showcased an increase of up to 3 times at individuals' satisfaction while the computational complexity is reduced to almost linear time serving the real-time implementation requirements.},

abstract = {Much of the recent transport focus in rural sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been on road building and upgrading as opposed to the provision of public transport. The literature reveals evidence of significant negative public health outcomes associated with crashes and pollution attributable to rural transport. We report the results of a synthesis of professional opinion obtained from in-person interviews and an internet survey on health issues related to the provision of public transport in rural SSA. Field interviews were conducted as semi-structured dialogues with some 40 transportation and public health professionals in the capital cities of Ethiopia, Ghana and Kenya. Additionally, 86 responses to an Internet survey were received from 38 African countries. Poor mechanical conditions of vehicles and risky driving behaviours were reported to be an important source of injury from rural road crashes. The factors contributing to unsafe rural public transport were attributable to economic barriers to proper operation. Although there was some mismatch among the survey and interview results and the literature, public transport was shown to be an important potential source of air pollution exposure. The overwhelming conclusion is the lack of true understanding of the health impacts of rural air pollution in relation to basic needs for provision of safe mobility. The findings reflect the awareness of various professional communities and emphasise the complexity of the relationship between rural public transport and public health. Transport and health relationships in places such as rural sub-Saharan Africa are further complicated by the fact that there is such significant potential for positive health outcomes attributable to transport through enhanced access to healthcare, education, commerce, etc. Systematic epidemiological research is needed to fully understand the trade-offs between rural mobility and its impacts to public health in rural sub-Saharan Africa.},

Although the systems have different contexts, design and operational characteristics, they have in common that over the last years their service quality has deteriorated, leading to negative users' perception and consequently decrease in patronage levels. Understanding these problematic factors is key for the mobility of these cities as they are both planning to expand their systems and consolidate multi-modal integrated transport systems in the upcoming years. Through a series of interviews with several stakeholders from institutions related to the mobility sector in each city our analysis identifies aspects of conceptual design, planning and implementation of institutional, operational, financial and management frameworks that might have been preventing the systems from achieving a better performance. Moreover, our analysis highlights two factors embedded at the core of the systems' difficulties: First, BRT technology transfer with limited understanding of context and little adaptation to local user's expectations and preferences; and second, design criteria that address financial requirements at the expense of quality of service for people's needs.},

However, recent research has identified considerable social and technical barriers that stand in the way of achieving these benefits. This paper uses sociotechnical systems theory and a review of open data research and practice guidelines to develop a preliminary ecosystem model for planning and designing OGD programs. Findings from two empirical case studies in New York and St. Petersburg, Russia produced an improved general model that addresses three questions: How can a given government's open data program stimulate and support an ecosystem of data producers, innovators, and users? In what ways and for whom do these the ecosystems produce benefits? Can an ecosystem approach help governments design effective open government data programs in diverse cultures and settings? The general model addresses policy and strategy, data publication and use, feedback and communication, benefit generation, and advocacy and interaction among stakeholders. We conclude that an ecosystem approach to planning and design can be widely used to assess existing conditions and to consider policies, strategies, and relationships that address realistic barriers and stimulate desired benefits.},

The framework is built on the basis of two recurring dimensions in research about people's concerns about privacy: one dimensions represents that people perceive particular data as more personal and sensitive than others, the other dimension represents that people's privacy concerns differ according to the purpose for which data is collected, with the contrast between service and surveillance purposes most paramount. These two dimensions produce a 2 × 2 framework that hypothesizes which technologies and data-applications in smart cities are likely to raise people's privacy concerns, distinguishing between raising hardly any concern (impersonal data, service purpose), to raising controversy (personal data, surveillance purpose). Specific examples from the city of Rotterdam are used to further explore and illustrate the academic and practical usefulness of the framework. It is argued that the general hypothesis of the framework offers clear directions for further empirical research and theory building about privacy concerns in smart cities, and that it provides a sensitizing instrument for local governments to identify the absence, presence, or emergence of privacy concerns among their citizens.},

abstract = {Earthquake safety paradigms in urban scenarios can be represented by the following: buildings response to ground shaking; possibility to evacuate urban areas; rescuers' assistance to evacuating pedestrians after reaching assembly points in the urban fabric. The first element is widely investigated and involves studies on buildings vulnerability and site hazard. Last two issues are strongly influenced by urban scenarios modifications due to the earthquake and human behaviours during both event and evacuation. Consequently, understanding how people behave in similar conditions becomes an essential issue in order to properly evaluate the urban risk assessment, efficiently organize evacuation procedures and plan interventions (on critical buildings, infrastructures). Hence, this paper firstly offers an overview of current literature on human behaviour in earthquake so far as urban scenario safety is concerned. Critical factors that determine individuals' response performances focus on human behaviours and environmental modifications due to the earthquake. The study underlines how some of the assumptions about the existing paradigms seem to be not consistent with the knowledge set out in the literature: individuals' behaviours are generally neglected while proposing risk-reduction strategies (management, interventions on buildings), and these strategies are supposed to directly induce correct emergency behaviours on people. On the contrary, a successful approach should combine traditional evaluations with innovative analyses on human behaviours and man-environment interactions in earthquake conditions: hence, this paper finally suggests a "behavioural design" approach. Following fire safety engineering criteria, simulation models would be used for evaluating the exposure parameter and check operative strategies for interferences reduction in emergency conditions.},

abstract = {In 2011, the Ministry of Transport (MoT) of China announced to competitively select and fund at least 30 cities in their respective efforts of building a transit metropolis. Incentivized by MoT, many Chinese cities have started planning for a transit metropolis and even implementing related measures. This signifies some larger-than-ever government-led efforts towards the transit metropolis that we have heard of. Why did China/MoT initiate the transit metropolis program? Is the transit metropolis idea of MoT similar to what Robert Cervero defines in his book, which introduces the concept of transit metropolis and illustrates it using 12 exemplars? If not, why? Have Chinese cities followed the same principles or taken comparable measures proposed or identified by Cervero? Or, have they produced brand new principles or measures? If so, what is the implication? This article answers the above questions through literature review, interviews, surveys and case studies. It shows that MoT's idea of the transit metropolis differs notably from that of Cervero. Even though MoT proposes more universal and quantitative performance measures for a transit metropolis than Cervero, its perspectives and policies are still parochial. Local governments, nevertheless, have comparable principles or measures like Cervero. But compared to a transit metropolis exemplar such as Curitiba, they overlook issues such as the match between regional commuter sheds and the services/administrative boundaries of local transit-related entities, coordinated, regionalized transit services and fares, pedestrian-friendly streets and parking pricing strategies. The above indicate that more work is needed to better define, plan and implement a transit metropolis in China.},

abstract = {Abstract Fixed daily trips such as trips to work/school have fixed departure/arrival times and destination points. The recurrent nature of fixed activities facilitates individuals on making more well-informed decisions about the transport mode selection. On the contrary, selecting a transportation mode for non-recurrent leisure trips, which can account for up to 60{\%} of trips in some cities (Transport for London, 2014), is a more complex task due to the fact that individuals have little knowledge about the alternative modal options. In this paper, we try to improve the operations of demand-responsive public transportation systems by increasing their service quality and their ridership related to joint-leisure-trips via timetable rescheduling. First, we model the public transport service re-scheduling problem considering operational regulations and the quality of service. Then, a sequential heuristic method is introduced for re-scheduling the timetables of demand-responsive public transport modes in near-real time and accommodating the joint leisure activity demand without deteriorating the quality of service. The public transport re-scheduling for increasing the joint leisure activity ridership was tested in a case study using user-generated data from social media in Stockholm and the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data from Sweden focusing especially on central bus lines 1 and 4. },

We present a novel method that provides strategic and operational decision support to companies maneuvering this competitive and constantly changing market environment. Using an extensive set of customer data in a zero-inflated regression model, we explain spatial variation in carsharing activity through the proximity of particular points of interests, such as movie theaters and airports. As an application case, as well as a validation of the model, we use the resulting indicators to predict the number of rentals before an expansion of the business area and compare it to the actual demand post-expansion. We find that our approach correctly identifies areas with a high carsharing activity and can be easily adapted to other cities.},

Requirements for RTPI - particularly for rural public transport users - are then identified for each type and stage of disruption through interviews and focus groups with rural passengers. Patterns of passenger behaviour during travel and transport disruptions are also classified. Further, a conceptual model of the recovery phases of disruption has been developed to map the RTPI requirements for each recovery phase of disruption. The model has been developed and evaluated through a series of focus groups and interviews with passengers, transport service providers, and government agencies. Finally, the paper also discusses and suggests the necessary advances in digital technologies for RTPI systems required to support public transport users during disruptions and thus minimise the number of trips abandoned.},

This lack of usage is partly due to crowd management involving a diversity of situations that require competencies in observing, sense-making, anticipating and acting. Crowd research is similarly scattered across disciplines and needs integration to advance the field towards supporting practice. To address these needs, we present inC. rowd, an integrated framework detailing a high-level architecture of a decision-support system for crowd management and model development. It also offers a lens for categorizing crowd literature, allowing us to present a structured literature review.},

abstract = {Big data generated across social media sites have created numerous opportunities for bringing more insights to decision-makers. Few studies on big data analytics, however, have demonstrated the support for strategic decision-making. Moreover, a formal method for analysing social media-generated big data for decision support is yet to be developed, particularly in the tourism sector. Using a design science research approach, this study aims to design and evaluate a 'big data analytics' method to support strategic decision-making in tourism destination management. Using geotagged photos uploaded by tourists to the photo-sharing social media site, Flickr, the applicability of the method in assisting destination management organisations to analyse and predict tourist behavioural patterns at specific destinations is shown, using Melbourne, Australia, as a representative case. Utility was confirmed using both another destination and directly with stakeholder audiences. The developed artefact demonstrates a method for analysing unstructured big data to enhance strategic decision making within a real problem domain. The proposed method is generic, and its applicability to other big data streams is discussed.},

abstract = {This article addresses the question of where urban low-carbon energy transitions are governed. A challenge is that urban governance is not simply urban, but a complex assemblage of institutions, networks and socio-technical arrangements. There are several on-going literature debates discussing the different types of processes in which cities are involved. I disaggregate these into vertical processes (multilevel governance perspectives), horizontal processes (network and policy mobility perspectives), and what I term infrastructural processes (steering by conditions in the built environment). The purpose of the article is to show how all these types of governance processes combine to drive urban low-carbon energy transitions. Using the notion of policy assemblage, I outline a framework through which the different types of governance processes can be reconciled. This is illustrated through a discussion of how the different types of processes interact in the context of urban low-carbon mobility in Europe. A discussion of the case of Stavanger, Norway, shows how different types of governance processes combine to drive and constrain low-carbon energy transitions and underlines the importance of taking seriously the constraints of the built environment.},

@article{Bosehans2016,
abstract = {This paper sought better to understand the motives and experiences of bus users, with a view to identifying subgroups who might be persuaded to use healthier and more sustainable modes. Student and staff bus users of a middle-sized university in the UK participated in an online survey, indicating their agreement with a series of statements about local bus services. These statements were combined into independent factors using principal component analysis. Then, using cluster analysis, respondents were split into different types of bus users. The analysis suggested six distinct types, four of which broadly support the captive versus choice user distinction made in earlier studies and two of which were novel. The findings are discussed in relation to previous research and implications for public transport operators and promoters of active travel are outlined. Specifically, the current research suggests that two subgroups of bus users, together accounting for around 41{\%} of this sample, may quite easily be persuaded to travel actively; the other groups, more committed to buses, might have their journeys improved if public transport operators address their concerns. Future research may address the generalisability of the proposed cluster solution and test its applicability in applied settings.},

Affinity in these networks is defined as the time-specific degree of equivalence between travel patterns of users in the system. TUNs reveal latent social structures typically invisible to their users, enabling circumstantial collaboration opportunities amongst them. To make TUNs explicit we quantify affinity as a combination of two measures: journey similarity and journey substitutability. In the urban public transport domain, TUNs enable the diffusion of knowledge across the system in real-time. This can assist passengers adjusting travel decisions to their preferences and objectives according to service status. An enriched Automated Fare Collection (AFC) system dataset is used to demonstrate the market potential of TUNs in the urban public transport domain.},

The paper focuses on the taxi apps and their impact on taxi markets. It provides a brief history of taxi regulation before outlining the underlying economic rationales of its current form in many parts of the world, characterised as the "QQE" framework (quantity, quality and economic controls on operators). It argues that current regulation assumes that taxi markets are subject to three sets of problems that require correction by regulatory intervention, namely: those associated with credence goods, problems related to open access and those resulting from transactions occurring in a thin market. It is then proposed that taxi apps solve both the credence good and thin market problems whilst largely mitigating the problems associated with open access. The paper then presents some potential problems for taxi apps, namely the potential for instability on supply and demand sides, collusion and monopoly. It also discusses concerns about driver background checks and safety. The paper concludes by arguing that instead of restricting the growth of the taxi market, regulators should focus on reducing the likelihood of monopoly and collusion in a taxi market led by apps.},

The focus in the literature is generally on methods and concept and/or on applications. Applications generally focus on ex ante or ex post evaluations of the implications for accessibility of (candidate) policy plans. An important question is which are the main challenges in the area of accessibility research? This paper aims to examine this question and provide a research agenda for the coming one or two decades or so. The focus is on putting relatively new topics on the agenda, rather than making suggestions for improvements of given accessibility indicators. The paper does not aim to provide a complete list, but rather proposes avenues for future research focusing on (1) indicators to express accessibility, and (2) evaluation. In the area of indicators the challenges include the impact of ICT on accessibility; the inclusion of the robustness of the transport system in indicators; comparing perceptions of accessibility and traditional accessibility indicators; the option value; and the indicators of accessibility for goods transport, air transport, and slow modes. In the area of evaluation the paper discusses the pros and cons of the logsum as an accessibility measure, ethical aspects, comparisons of accessibility indicators to evaluate a specific case, and the needs of the clients of accessibility research.},

We apply a semantic topic model classification and spatial autocorrelation analysis to detect tweets indicating specific human social activities. We correlated observed tweet patterns with official census data for the case study of London in order to underline the significance and reliability of Twitter data. Our empirical results of semantic and spatiotemporal clustered tweets show an overall strong positive correlation in comparison with workplace population census data, being a good indicator and representative proxy for analyzing workplace-based activities.},

In this paper, a utility maximization model for capturing automatically users' willingness to travel a certain distance for participating in different activity types based on user-generated data is introduced. The model is based on Big-Data analytics on user-generated data from Social Media that can offer valuable insights into users' preferences and improve our understanding on their decision-making mechanisms for selecting joint activities. Unlike static approaches, the utility model of each agent is developed to incorporate continuously updated data feeds regarding agents' activities (i.e., timing of visiting a POI, type of POI). The agent-utility model is implemented and tested via utilizing geo-tagged, social media data from 65 individuals from the dense city of London (crawling campaign from November 2012-January 2014). After implementing the utility-maximization model, all users are clustered based on their willingness to travel similar distances to participate in certain types of activities, facilitating the development of applications for suggesting joint activities among agents with similar profiles.},

Initially, an online survey was conducted with 227 adults who did or did not use self-monitoring solutions with their cycling. We found that the most important features for cyclists who use self-monitoring are: time it takes to travel, cycling speed, and distance covered. In contrast, cyclists who do not use self-monitoring perceived features related to location (e.g. directions with maps) as the most important ones. In a subsequent study we included self-monitoring solutions as a part of mixed-design, small-scale, longitudinal intervention aimed at changing transportation patterns. We found that self-monitoring is mainly suitable for performance oriented cyclists rather then recreational cyclists. We discuss the implications of those results for designing interventions to promote cycling.},

The reason is that the maximum passenger carrying capacity of a transit station is determined by the scheduled timetable. In addition, passengers always choose departure time according to their own need, which varies with time. Based on the traditional two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and gravity method, this paper proposes two new methods to evaluate transit accessibility. The proposed methods are implemented to evaluate the bus accessibility of Xiamen City, China. According to the local bus timetable, a typical workday is divided into three periods. Within each time period, bus travel supply-to-demand ratios by station are calculated and then aggregated into the traffic analysis zone (TAZ). The empirical findings show that fluctuations in travel demand and the passenger carrying capacity of bus stations in different time periods make the bus accessibility significantly differ throughout the city. They also show that bus accessibility based on the extended 2SFCA model are equivalent to that based on the extended gravity model, when the total demand is relatively lower than the total passenger carrying capacity of a bus station.},

Secondly, emerging developments are discussed to identify the most promising service innovation dynamics. Finally, foresight scenarios demonstrate possible future trends of the new service economy. These scenarios are based on a methodology developed and applied in the context of an EC-funded project on Sectoral Innovation Systems. This exercise is performed for the overall set of services activities although a particular focus is given on activities such as knowledge intensive business services and distributive trade services. Results indicate that emerging developments are those related to the reconciliation between industrialisation and customisation associated with ICT, ageing population, sustainable development and service regression and extension dynamics. The cases of knowledge intensive services and distributive trades have shown how different drivers and emerging developments are interrelated and establish different scenarios for future development.},

abstract = {Dominant discourses tend to represent young people as politically apathetic, disengaged and inert. Yet, in late 2010, tens of thousands of young people across the UK protested against government proposals to change the ways in which higher education is funded. In numerous universities across the country, students occupied buildings, facilitated protests and challenged university leaders to speak out against the proposed changes. At Newcastle University, a group of highly organised students occupied the Fine Art lecture theatre for seventeen days in late 2010 in resistance to these changes. In this paper, we draw upon a detailed analysis of twenty-seven interviews with young people who participated in the Newcastle Occupation, supplemented by participant observation of Occupation meetings. We argue that the students created an intentionally dialogic space in the Occupation in a number of ways, including how they organised it, how they used social media and the internet, the actions they participated in and the ways in which they engaged with the elite. These insights offer an important contribution to debates and young people and politics and exemplify the ways in which the student activists involved in the Newcastle Occupation were sophisticated political agents who strategically and tactfully engaged with politics matters.},

abstract = {This paper presents research into new ways in which organisations can gather field-based consumer insight particularly in public spaces. In an increasingly complex and fast moving business world, there is a need for quicker and more efficient consumer experience research that also provides a wider focus on the situation under investigation as required when studying urban spaces. The paper presents a method called DiCER for using large groups of non-specialists (i.e non-ethnographers) to make fieldwork observations working in a transdisciplinary setting with ethnographers and designers. In this method, groups of people are given a small amount of training and provided with support materials that allow them to make and report observations. The method provides a way of harnessing the potential of an organisation׳s staff for a shared goal of generating useful fieldwork material. The method was first tried out in two studies that investigated how collaborative activity could be facilitated in large public spaces. This helped identify issues related to the design of support materials whilst conducting fieldwork and explored ways of analysing and presenting the results of such activity. A follow-up study observed the activity of conversations between strangers waiting in a railway station concourse. The aim of this was to test both the method on a more focused problem and prototype tools to support recording observations in such a context. The outcomes were prototypes and interventions demonstrating potential techniques for gathering fieldwork material. A final study explored the potential of using a group of non-specialist employees distributed across an organisation to fulfil parts of a fieldwork project. This guided the development of training sessions for people with little prior knowledge of doing fieldwork. The main output was design recommendations for further applications of the method in a similar context.},

In this environment smartcards represent a strategic instrument to link citizens to public administration and local infrastructure to further advance on smart city plans. This research proposes a theoretical model and present privacy and security as key drivers of citizens' intentions to continue using smartcards. The functional benefits (i.e. usefulness and ease-of-use), the level of personal interaction with local services, and the direct and moderating effects of socio-demographic variables complete our framework. The findings of an empirical study with smartcard users in Zaragoza (Spain) show usefulness and security as the main antecedents of continuance intentions. In turn, the influence of socio-demographic variables is not significant, which suggests that smartcards should focus on a wide-range of users. These results offer interesting implications and recommendations for public managers such as the need to guarantee the security of the transaction system and to expand the number of services and initiatives relaying on the smartcard service in order to gradually develop the smart city transformation.},

abstract = {This study tested the idea that promoting bicycle safety might inadvertently discourage bicycling by having negative effects on how the activity is perceived. It also tested the idea that stressing the health benefits of bicycling would have a positive effect on perceptions and intentions to cycle. Two-hundred and twenty-eight adults were randomly allocated to read safety-focused, health-focused, or control publicity materials and their immediate influences on bicycling perceptions were measured. Health-focused materials significantly increased bicyclings perceived health benefits amongst non-bicyclists and had no influence on perceived risk; the safety-focused campaign had no effect on either perceived risks or health benefits for either group. Neither campaign measurably changed intentions to bicycle nor the perceived enjoyment of bicycling, both of which were clearly higher amongst bicyclists than non-bicyclists. The study suggests that safety-focused campaigns are unlikely to have any immediate effect on peoples perceptions and intentions to cycle, whether positive or negative; health-focused campaigns, on the other hand, make bicycling appear more beneficial to those who do not currently do it. In addition, although the possibility exists that current bicyclists are a qualitatively different sub-population, able to enjoy bicycling in non-conducive environments, their rating bicycling as more enjoyable than non-bicyclists hints that new campaigns might usefully emphasise the enjoyment of bicycling to encourage its uptake.},

In the expectation that public demand for these apps will increase as both road traffic and smartphone ownership rise, these tools invite consideration alongside other traffic management tools. Traffic app-specific considerations include increased motorist interactivity, consumer technology diffusion, and institutional factors affecting the rollout of e-government initiatives. This article uses the introduction of the MMDA Traffic Navigator-a Manila-based, publicly developed traffic app-to illustrate these considerations. Additionally, app usage among residents of nearby cities constituting Manila's extended metropolitan region is considered. These considerations are subsequently classified using a 4E framework under economy, effectiveness, efficiency, and equity to inform other authorities' efforts to either incorporate traffic apps into overall transport planning or even take the initiative in developing them.},

In addition, this work introduces the main characteristics of the IES Cities platform, whose goal is to ease the generation of citizen-centric apps that exploit urban data in different domains. The proposed vision is achieved by providing a common access mechanism to the heterogeneous data sources offered by the city, which reduces the complexity of accessing the city's data whilst bringing citizens closely to a . prosumer (double consumer and producer) role and allowing to integrate legacy data into the cities' data ecosystem.},

The use of new communications and database technologies in LMICs is generating 'big data' (for example from the use of mobile phones, mobile-based financial services and the internet) which is collected and processed by corporations. When shared, these data are also becoming a potentially valuable resource for development research and policy. With these new sources of data, new power structures are emerging within the field of development. We identify two trends in particular, illustrating them with examples: first, the empowerment of public-private partnerships around datafication in LMICs and the consequently growing agency of corporations as development actors. Second, the way commercially generated big data is becoming the foundation for country-level 'data doubles', i.e. digital representations of social phenomena and/or territories that are created in parallel with, and sometimes in lieu of, national data and statistics. We explore the resulting shift from legibility (Scott, 1998) to visibility, and the implications of seeing development interventions as a byproduct of larger-scale processes of informational capitalism.},

In recent decades, large industrial facilities have been established in Chennai and its suburbs-resulting in large-scale population growth.

In this profile, we provide an overview of Chennai's urban history from social, economic, political, and environmental perspectives. We highlight the current and future challenges faced by the city, and we argue that it is well poised to leverage emerging smart city technologies. However, to effectively implement these technologies, city administrators need to undertake several measures; for example, a database capturing all dimensions of the city must be developed.

The local authority in Cape Town has an explicit policy to provide affordable and appropriate mobility options for all; at the same time, it is concerned with environmental and economic sustainability, and global status. Recently, public bicycle systems have received increased attention in the city, yet business models that depend on advertising revenue, automation, and credit card possession are likely to exclude the urban poor, who live beyond the central city and seldom can afford the security requirements such systems may require.The paper thus examines the tensions between the glamour of a globally competitive city, and the multiple unmet mobility needs of city residents; and begins to ask the questions: what role might an iconic, urban, public bicycle system play in Cape Town? What economic, sustainability or mobility needs might this serve? And how might a shared bicycle system business model operate if it were to serve the transport disadvantaged?.},

In this study, a path analysis is used to analyze the relationships between personal characteristics, neighborhood characteristics, travel behavior, social interactions, social satisfaction and loneliness. The analyses are based on data collected in Eindhoven and surrounding towns in the Netherlands in a survey among 177 respondents. Results show relationships between mobility and social aspects. They indicate that frequency of walking affects social satisfaction, frequency of cycling affects the number of social interactions and car ownership affects loneliness. Regarding the neighborhood characteristics, interesting results are found as well. The percentage of non-western ethnic minorities in the neighborhood is found to negatively affect social satisfaction, social cohesion is found to affect the number of social interactions and place attachment is found to affect loneliness.},

ABSTUR has been experienced by assisting a group of tourism experts in designing a set of tourist routes in the historic center of Madrid. In this manner, experts were able to avoid collections of routes with overcrowded or non-profitable routes.

The application is designed to run in the background, and continuously collects data from built-in acceleration and network location sensors. The collected data is analyzed automatically and partitioned into activity segments. A key finding of our work is that walking activity can be robustly detected in the data stream, which, in turn, acts as a separator for partitioning the data stream into other activity segments. Each vehicle activity segment is then sub-classified according to the vehicle type. Our approach yields high accuracy despite the low sampling interval and does not require GPS data. As a result, device power consumption is effectively minimized. This is a very crucial point for large-scale real-world deployment. As part of an experiment, the application has been used by 495 samples, and our prototype provides 82{\%} accuracy in transportation mode classification for an experiment performed in Zurich, Switzerland. Incorporating location type information with this activity classification technology has the potential to impact many phenomena driven by human mobility and to enhance awareness of behavior, urban planning, and agent-based modeling.},

abstract = {Location-based check-in services in various social media applications have enabled individuals to share their activity-related choices providing a new source of human activity data. Although geo-location data has the potential to infer multi-day patterns of individual activities, appropriate methodological approaches are needed. This paper presents a technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns of users' weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities (a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information. This work provides foundational tools that can be used when geo-location data is available to predict disaggregate activity patterns. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

STAR-CITY, which integrates (human and machine-based) sensor data using variety of formats, velocities and volumes, has been designed to provide insight on historical and real-time traffic conditions, all supporting efficient urban planning. Our system demonstrates how the severity of road traffic congestion can be smoothly analyzed, diagnosed, explored and predicted using semantic web technologies. Our prototype of semantics-aware traffic analytics and reasoning, illustrated and experimented in Dublin Ireland, but also tested in Bologna Italy, Miami USA and Rio Brazil works and scales efficiently with real, historical together with live and heterogeneous stream data. This paper highlights the lessons learned from deploying and using a system in Dublin City based on Semantic Web technologies.},

abstract = {Information flow plays a central role in the development of transport policy, transport planning and the effective operation of the transport system. The recent upsurge in web enabled and pervasive technologies offer the opportunity of a new route for dynamic information flow that captures the views, needs and experiences of the travelling public in a timely and direct fashion through social media text posts. To date there is little published research, however, on how to realize this opportunity for the sector by capturing and analysing the text data.This paper provides an overview of the different categories of social media, the characteristics of its content and how these characteristics are reflected in transport-related posts. The research described in this paper includes a formulation of the goals for harvesting transport-related information from social media, the hypotheses to be tested to demonstrate that such information can provide valuable input to transport policy development or delivery and the challenges this involves.A hierarchical approach for categorizing transport-related information harvested from social media is presented. An explanatory study was designed, based on the understanding of the nature of social media content, the goals in harvesting it for transport planning and management purposes and existing text mining techniques. An exploratory case study is used to illustrate the process based on Twitter posts associated with particular UK sporting fixtures (i.e. football matches).The results demonstrate both the volume and pertinence of the information obtained. Whilst text-mining techniques have been applied in a number of other sectors (notably entertainment, business and the political arena), the use of information in the transport sector has some unique features that stem from both day-to-day operational practices and the longer term decision making processes surrounding the transport system - hence the significance and novelty of the results reported here. Many challenges in refining the methodology and techniques remain for future research, however the outcomes presented here are of relevance to a wide range of stakeholders in the transport and text mining fields. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The growth of private motorised urban mobility has become a key issue in relation to environmental quality in China's cities. This paper reports on a nationwide study of the changes in car use in the 2000s, conducted in eleven large cities. This may assist us in filling the gaps in our existing knowledge, which is based on individual city cases. It is apparent that China's large cities are embracing a new era of the automobile at an unexpected speed and scale. However, at the same time, it seems that a 'peak' in car use has occurred in Shanghai and Beijing, as either the absolute number of VKT per capita has dropped or its growth has slowed in these cities. The changes in urban mobility are deeply affected by social and economic transition factors. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the effects of increasing incomes and the growing middle class, changing lifestyles and the emerging consumer society, the appearance of the e-Society and an increasingly ageing society. In particular, the growing demand for car use by the younger generation (G2), women and elderly people for the purpose of social activity has become an important force behind the increase in overall VKT. The paper concludes with a discussion of current theoretical perspectives and the issues which should be addressed in future research on the social aspects of private motorised urban mobility in China.},

In order to explore the barriers to social and labor exclusion it was elaborated a survey relating with the use and impact of ITC in social and labor experiences of rural women. The results showed that rural women are aware of the key role played for ITC on their way to achieve the participation on decision making process as well as in social life and labor. The main barriers to the Internet penetration in women social life were employment, education and income. From an individual point of view, the existence of non-users was explained by a combination of access problems, lack of ICT skills or rather negative attitudes towards ITC. Finally, a bunch of policy recommendations is proposed focus on providing better Internet access in rural areas and to sensitize the population, particularly the oldest, about the importance of gender equality in access to technology in order to avoid digital barriers for rural women and reduce social exclusion of this group. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The principal premise of a u-eco-city is to provide a high quality of life and place to residents, workers and visitors with low-to-no negative impacts on the natural environment with support from the state-of-the-art technologies in their planning, development and management. The paper aims to put this premise into a test and address whether u-eco-city is a dazzling smart and sustainable urban form that constitutes an ideal 21st century city model or just a branding hoax. It, first, explores the recent developments and trends in ubiquitous technologies, infrastructures, services and management systems, and their utilisation and implications for the development of u-eco-cities.

To identify the key issues and research priorities in PPGIS, two researchers that have designed and implemented more than 40 empirical studies spanning both environmental and urban applications present their views about the present and future of PPGIS for land use planning and management. This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus of the key issues and research priorities. We have organized the paper into six general key issues and four priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) conceptual and theoretical foundations, (2) the diversity of definitions and approaches to participatory mapping, (3) the spatial attributes measured in participatory mapping, (4) sampling, participation, and data quality, (5) relationships between participatory mapped attributes and physical places, and (6) the integration of PPGIS data into planning decision support. Our top research priorities include: (1) understanding and increasing participation rates, (2) identifying and controlling threats to spatial data quality, (3) improving the "PP" or public participation in PPGIS, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of PPGIS. Our purpose for presenting a research agenda is to stimulate discourse among PPGIS researchers and practitioners about future research needs and to provide support for the mobilization of resources to undertake future empirical research. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change poses a serious challenge to sustainable urban development, placing many cities at risk. Climatic conditions are changing to such an extent that the capacity of urban institutions and associated governance systems to deal with climatic extremes and variability is being reduced. New approaches for urban climate change adaptation are thus urgently needed.There is an increasing consensus that local-level capacities are critical for successful adaptation to climate change and the achievement of sustainable development. However, knowledge about local-level capacities is scarce, and regulatory frameworks are often ambiguous in terms of assigning (complementary) responsibilities for adaptation to institutions and citizens. Against that background, the paper investigates the adaptive practice of Swedish citizens and how this relates to local municipalities' adaptation efforts and to the 'interface' between citizens' and institutions' legal responsibilities. By theorising the interplay between the adaptive practice of citizens and institutions, it demonstrates that adaptive capacity at the local level does not automatically translate into adaptation itself, thus showing the requirement for planned and more complementary interventions. The outcomes suggest the need for more distributed urban risk governance systems and people-oriented planning to foster an adaptive and sustainable transformation of cities. The potential scope of action for more people-oriented adaptation planning is presented. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

It proposes a confirmatory framework for studies on university students׳ commuting mode and housing choice and their determinants. It also conducts a case study based on this framework to get more insights. This case study shows or re-confirms that when compared to the employees from the same university, university students are more likely to share a residence in exchange for rent affordability, bus proximity and short commute. They are also more likely to jointly determine their housing and mode choices. Transit pass subsidies significantly influence university students' alternative transportation use. Female students or graduate students are less likely to use alternative transportation. Undergraduate students have a shorter commute and use alternative transportation more. The above provide new implications for integrated housing–transportation planning and group-sensitive policies to increase alternative transportation usage among university students.},

Recent studies have also recognized that users' social interactions and land use patterns influence travel behavior, especially when changes to transport systems are introduced, but links between international and Spanish perspectives are rarely deal. In this paper, factorial and path analyses through a Multiple-Indicator Multiple-Cause (MIMIC) model are used to understand and describe the relationship between the different psychological and environmental constructs with social influence and socioeconomic variables. The MIMIC model generates Latent Variables (LVs) to be incorporated sequentially into Discrete Choice Models (DCM) where the levels of service and cost attributes of travel modes are also included directly to measure the effect of the transport policies that have been introduced in Madrid during the last three years in the context of the economic crisis.

abstract = {Mobile devices are increasingly pervasive and are transforming information distribution paradigms. A rapidly growing segment of urban public transport passengers carry mobile computing devices, permanently and on the move. In a context of thinning financial resources, getting customers involved in the actual delivery of a public transport service as real-time information consumers and providers, may be a powerful method to enhance travel experience while reducing operational costs for the service operator. Each and every customer travelling on a public transport network has unique knowledge about the service operation as it unfolds. This paper proposes a framework that aims to unify public transport passengers' collective intelligence through crowdsourcing, using their mobile computing devices and dedicated web services. It strives to intensify win-win relationships between public transport passengers and operators. The structured exchange of information is sustained by a validation mechanism for data reliability, and an incentive mechanism to encourage passenger participation. Passengers benefit from rich real-time data tailored to their profiles, to ease their journeys and improve travel experience, in exchange for their own participation providing and validating information. Operators gain access to rich customer generated data, which in an aggregated format may provide a real-time assessment of customer experience and of local performance across the entire network operation. Operators may be required to reward travellers who become prolific co-creators of the public transport service, but higher customer experience levels, lesser needs for investment in controlling mechanisms, and continuous free monitoring of customer opinions can jointly lead to financial returns.},

abstract = {In the last few years a new research area, called stream reasoning, emerged to bridge the gap between reasoning and stream processing. While current reasoning approaches are designed to work on mainly static data, the Web is, on the other hand, extremely dynamic: information is frequently changed and updated, and new data is continuously generated from a huge number of sources, often at high rate. In other words, fresh information is constantly made available in the form of streams of new data and updates. Despite some promising investigations in the area, stream reasoning is still in its infancy, both from the perspective of models and theories development, and from the perspective of systems and tools design and implementation. The aim of this paper is threefold: (i) we identify the requirements coming from different application scenarios, and we isolate the problems they pose; (ii) we survey existing approaches and proposals in the area of stream reasoning, highlighting their strengths and limitations; (iii) we draw a research agenda to guide the future research and development of stream reasoning. In doing so, we also analyze related research fields to extract algorithms, models, techniques, and solutions that could be useful in the area of stream reasoning. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mobile Internet access is the key technology to enable vehicular infotainment applications such as downloading of maps and multimedia contents. Mobile Internet access through roadside APs has emerged as an alternative to cellular networks due to its high bandwidth and low cost. However, due to the sparse deployment of roadside APs, connectivity disruption might take place when vehicles travel between APs. In addition, the IP address will also change as the vehicle changes its attachment to the network. This creates problems to existing IP applications as they are not designed to handle connectivity disruption and change of address. Furthermore, as a vehicle travels at high speed, its contact with a roadside AP will be brief. It is necessary to effectively utilize such brief contacts. In this paper, we propose a MObile Network Access framework (MONA) to address these issues. MONA protects application connections from connectivity disruptions by introducing a Terminal Local Proxy (TLP) which splits application connections such that connectivity disruptions are transparent to the applications. By enabling cooperative relaying, MONA exploits opportunistic contacts for additional data transfer. Through simulation and numerical analysis, MONA is shown to be able to exploit both direct and indirect contact opportunities and delivers more than existing PCMP scheme. This shows MONA is a viable approach and it can serve as a complementing technology to various existing techniques and contribute to the development of a more complete solution for mobile Internet access. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Adding to the current debate, this article focuses on the personal data and privacy challenges posed by private industry's use of smart mobile devices that provide location-based services to users and consumers. Directly relevant to personal data protection are valid concerns about the collection, retention, use and accessibility of this kind of personal data, in relation to which a key issue is whether valid consent is ever obtained from users. While it is indisputable that geo-location technologies serve important functions, their potential use for surveillance and invasion of privacy should not be overlooked. Thus, in this study we address the question of how a legal regime can ensure the proper functionality of geo-location technologies while preventing their misuse. In doing so, we examine whether information gathered from geo-location technologies is a form of personal data, how it is related to privacy and whether current legal protection mechanisms are adequate. We argue that geo-location data are indeed a type of personal data. Not only is this kind of data related to an identified or identifiable person, it can reveal also core biographical personal data. What is needed is the strengthening of the existing law that protects personal data (including location data), and a flexible legal response that can incorporate the ever-evolving and unknown advances in technology. ?? 2014 Anne SY Cheung.

This will result in investments of ??7.4 million over the period 2012 to 2014, of which ??4.5 million will come from central government. Investments will include installation of Wi-Fi on vehicles, Near Field Communication (NFC) tags and Next Stop Displays and Announcement systems, along with marketing initiatives, the development of mobile apps and the refurbishment of buses. These investments will be complemented by other initiatives in the conurbation, not least some ??27 million of investments from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund over the period 2012 to 2015, including the development of key interchange points and bus corridors. This paper will outline the methodology that has been developed to monitor and evaluate these investments and will detail the baseline surveys that have been undertaken, the anticipated impacts on attitudes to and usage of bus services and the results of the initial implementation of the investment programme. The extent to which such investments can revitalise bus services in an area where there has been a long run historic decline will be assessed.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was the investigation of travel behavioral effects of the reduction in traffic capacity resulting from the construction of the West LRT (Light Rail Transit) line in the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Travelers' responses to real-time information providing traffic updates and advisory detours due to lane/road closures were also examined. The West LRT alignment extends approximately 8.2 km from downtown into the city's southwest. Many road closures took place in the vicinity of the LRT line construction zones, inducing significant delays to traffic. Data on travelers' behavioral responses and responses to real-time information were obtained by conducting a survey on a sample of users of the main road affected by the construction. The survey also investigated the effects of West LRT line construction on drivers' daily commutes, including increases in travel times, mode choices, alternate route choices, and selection of sources of information on traffic conditions. A significant change in the selection of transportation mode was caused by West LRT construction. Throughout the construction period, there was a decrease in the percentage of respondents who reported private vehicles as their first choice and an increase in the percentage of respondents who preferred public transit as their first and second choices. Radio was found to be the most preferred source for traffic updates and detour advice, followed by variable message signs (VMS). The findings of the en-route information model showed that driving experience, employment status, travel time and purpose, and desire for pre-trip information had significant effects on traveler's rerouting decisions after getting en-route information through VMS. The results from this study are of interest for understanding behavioral changes for the purposes of traffic management, mitigation schemes and design of advanced traveler information systems in response to network disruptions.?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The emergence of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) has been recognised with many initiatives during the last 20 years. In Europe, the " ITS Action Plan" identifies a number of applications as key elements contributing to the efficient co-ordination of the overall transport chain. The context and experience surrounding the recent widespread development of technological tools and ICT platforms to support the emergence of ITS are notable for the way in which they permeate the transport and logistics chain. But a key question remains: to what extent is the public transport sector able to exploit the wider benefits of ITS?This paper provides a comparative analysis of ITS policy between Europe and Australia. With a focus on the applications and methods adopted in the use of ITS in the public transport sector in Australia the paper critiques their effectiveness in enhancing passenger experience, operator effectiveness and the likely effect on patronage. The relatively low incidence of the use of ITS in the public transport system in Australia, as compared to Europe, is discussed in the context of technology trends/pathways and impediments to deployment in the public transport sector. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The impact of gasoline price changes on traffic safety has received increasing attention in empirical studies. In this study, we use time geography to provide a theoretical framework for examining the effects of time-varying fluctuations in gasoline prices and their relationship to traffic safety in a case study of Mississippi from April 2004 to December 2010. Application of time geography theory suggests that gasoline prices act as one type of capability constraint of the space-time path. As gasoline prices increase (that is, as the capability constraint becomes stronger), we hypothesize traffic crash rates decrease, and they decrease more for groups for whom the constraint is stronger. The results corroborate the hypotheses and suggest that gasoline prices have stronger effects on reducing less severe crashes and negligible effects on reducing fatal crashes. Gasoline price effects on reducing crashes start at a 9-month lag, peak at a 12-month lag, and diminish after an 18-month lag. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Success of such planning efforts depends on consensus and support among the key stakeholders and also the general public. This research investigates the impact of stakeholder attitudes and perception on rail infrastructure planning efforts in Missouri, a Midwestern state in the USA. It is important that stakeholders with an interest in community economic development play an active role in the development of the rail network. Ample opportunity must be provided for meaningful input, and stakeholders must be aware that their issues have been heard and understood. Data collected through surveys, interviews, focus group discussions, and public meetings conducted across the state are used to develop a stakeholder engagement process. The social factors and uncertainties that affect planning for a sustainable rail network are identified and validated using qualitative and quantitative methods. The process developed provides guidance to transportation planners in the creation of a comprehensive rail plan. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

One of the applications that can benefit from this data is the study of urban environments. In this context, one of the main problems is the detection of dense areas, i.e.; areas with a high density of individuals within a specific geographical region and time period. Nevertheless, the techniques used so far face an important limitation: the definition of dense area is not adaptive and as a result the areas identified are related to a threshold applied over the density of individuals, which usually implies that dense areas are mainly identified in downtowns. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, called AdaptiveDAD, to detect dense areas that adaptively define the concept of density using the infrastructure provided by a cell phone network. We evaluate and validate our approach with a real dataset containing the Call Detail Records (CDR) of fifteen million individuals. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {South Africa has an unsustainably high level of private vehicles and vehicle-kilometres, yet there is still no real visible shift to public transport in the urban areas. Public transport does not appear to be an attractive option for private vehicle users, as operations are perceived to be unreliable and not on-par with the experience of private vehicle users. Even when a mode is both comfortable and reliable, private vehicle users exhibit extreme inertia to transfer to public transport. At the same time that our transport systems are moving in unsustainable directions, there has been a significant adoption of mobile phones by the general populace. Tracking this proliferation of mobile devices has been an exponential improvement in the processing power, user experience and sensing abilities of mobile phones. We are starting to see transport systems being impacted by this massive increase in the collective processing power of a city. It is thus now worth considering a paradigm shift as to how public transport systems are configured to incorporate the potential that mobile phones and their mass adoption present to urban transport systems. "Mobility" is defined in this paper as the use of mobile technology in order to create an Informational Decision-Making Layer above the Hard Infrastructure of transport systems, as well as the Operational Layer of vehicles and operations. As part of this "Mobility" paradigm shift, the author has conceptualized, designed, developed, implemented and operates GoMetro, a large-scale mobile web-based public transport information system for Metrorail operations in South Africa. The paper the author would like to submit will seek to answer the following questions: - With the increase in mobile phone penetration, and the collective processing power of an urban environment is it time to rethink the traditional transport model consisting of a Way and a Vehicle? - What is Mobility? And what is a Mobility Strategy? - How does Mobility compare to traditional communication channels? - How do commuters interact with their mobile devices while commuting? - Is there a Business Case for operators and agencies to implement a Mobility Strategy? If implemented, what are some lessons learnt from GoMetro? - What is the social benefit of Mobility to an urban transport system?},

Barriers include institutional frameworks such as policy and regulation; economic issues of funding and fares; operational issues of fleet and vehicles; as well as operator and community attitudes; and information and education.

In addition to the key themes for rural ageing research identified by IRAP, the authors believe that there are others topics that will emerge and impact on rural ageing in Europe in the coming decade. These have been highlighted consistently in futures studies as 'global challenges' and can be grouped as social, economic and political, technological, relating to climate change, or related to agriculture and food security. In addition to the literature review, the authors undertook a consultation exercise with more than 50 eminent academics and directors of key organisations who were interested in rural issues, 'global challenges' or rural ageing. Their feedback is included within a framework for future rural research.

Study participants were selected on the basis of being 'informal experts' - reflecting their affinity for engagement with ICTs. Through an exploration of the interview findings, it becomes clear that relatively new technological devices and applications have quickly become embedded into the participants' everyday travel and communications. Changes in social practice at the level of the individuals are not visibly dramatic, but at the same time, there is evidence of a cumulative influence of ICTs on their daily lives. Technologies are enabling the participants to better accommodate the uncertainties in activity and travel scheduling and yet also contributing to a 'fluidity' in time-space co-ordination of activities. They are also allowing the juggling of life roles in time and space leading to apparent fragmenting of activities.
