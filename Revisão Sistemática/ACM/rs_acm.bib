abstract = {ICT is becoming an enabler for smart city applications by making effective use of various data resources generated daily in an urban environment. Mostly this data is utilised by city authorities for city planning purposes and often citi- zens become indirect beneficiaries of such applications. In this paper we present an algorithm for real-time processing of streaming data from multiple sources. We also present the design and proof of concept of an application that per- forms mining and analysis of open data available through city portals and social networks and generates an informa- tion service in real time for use by city administrations. The prototype utilises streaming data from Twitter and open data from Bristol to demonstrate a hypothetical scenario using Apache Storm. The output is presented in the form of visual maps using OpenStreetMaps as a backend and the prototype highlights various challenges which are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {The study of disaster events and their impact in the ur-ban space has been traditionally conducted through manual collections and analysis of surveys, questionnaires and au-thority documents. While there have been increasingly rich troves of human behavioral data related to the events of interest, the ability to obtain hindsight following a disas-ter event has not been scaled up. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel approach for analyzing events called PairFac. PairFac utilizes discriminant tensor analysis to automati-cally discover the impact of a major event from rich human behavioral data. Our method aims to (i) uncover the persis-tent patterns across multiple interrelated aspects of urban behavior (e.g., when, where and what citizens do in a city) and at the same time (ii) identify the salient changes follow-ing a potentially impactful event. We show the effectiveness of PairFac in comparison with previous methods through extensive experiments. We also demonstrate the advantages of our approach through case studies with real-world traffic sensor data and social media streams surrounding the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Our work has both methodological contributions in studying the impact of an external stimulus on a system as well as practical implications in the area of disaster event analysis and assessment.},

The results are mapped to the geographical structure of the city in order to study differences and commonalities at the neighborhood level. The whole approach is applied and illustrated in the context of the city of Mexico and pollution perception as a case study.

abstract = {Many "big data" applications must tame velocity (processing data in-motion) and variety (processing many different types of data) simultaneously. The research on knowledge representation and reasoning has focused on the variety of data, devising data representation and processing techniques that promote integration and reasoning on available data to extract implicit information. On the other hand, the event and stream processing community has focused on the velocity of data, producing systems that efficiently operate on streams of data on-the-fly according to pre-deployed processing rules or queries. Several recent works explore the synergy between stream processing and reasoning to fully capture the requirements of modern data intensive applications, thus giving birth to the research domain of stream reasoning. This tutorial paper offers an overview of the theoretical and technological achievements in stream reasoning, highlighting the key benefits and limitations of existing approaches, and discussing the open challenges and the opportunities for future research. The paper mainly targets researchers and practitioners in the area of event and stream processing. The paper aims to stimulate the discussion on stream reasoning and to further promote the integration of reasoning techniques within event and stream processing systems in three ways: (i) by presenting an active research domain, where researchers on event and stream processing can apply their expertise; (ii) by discussing techniques and technologies that can help advancing the state of the art in event and stream processing; (iii) by identifying the open problems in the field of stream reasoning, and drawing attention to promising research directions.},

We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight legally-blind participants, and presented them with three scenarios to inspire discussion relating to SIIDs. Nine main themes emerged from analysis of the participant interviews, including the challenges faced when using a mobile device one-handed while using a cane to detect obstacles along the intended path, the impact of using a mobile device under inhospitable conditions, and concerns associated with using a mobile device in environments where privacy and safety may be compromised (e.g. when using public transport). These were found to reduce the quality of the subjective interaction experience, and in some cases limiting use of mobile technologies in public venues. Insights from our research can be used to guide the design of future mobile interfaces to better meet the needs of users whose needs are often excluded from the design process.},

Our work fills this gap by focusing on Lebanon, a country with longstanding political instability, and the wayfinding issues there stemming from missing street signs and names, a poor road infrastructure, and a nonstandardized addressing system. We examine the relationship between technology literate individuals' navigation and direction giving strategies and their usage of current digital navigation aids. Drawing on an interview study (N=12) and a web survey (N=85), our findings show that while these individuals rely on mapping services and WhatsApp's share location feature to aid wayfinding, many technical and cultural problems persist that are currently resolved through social querying.

In this paper, we study the feasibility of crowd-sourced mobility analytics over aggregate location information: users periodically report their location, using a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol, so that the server can only recover aggregates -- i.e., how many, but not which, users are in a region at a given time. We experiment with real-world mobility datasets obtained from the Transport For London authority and the San Francisco Cabs network, and present a novel methodology based on time series modeling that is geared to forecast traffic volumes in regions of interest and to detect mobility anomalies in them. In the presence of anomalies, we also make enhanced traffic volume predictions by feeding our model with additional information from correlated regions. Finally, we present and evaluate a mobile app prototype, called Mobility Data Donors (MDD), in terms of computation, communication, and energy overhead, demonstrating the real-world deployability of our techniques.},

@article{Chen2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.Bike sharing is booming globally as a green transportation mode, but the occurrence of over-demand stations that have no bikes or docks available greatly affects user experiences. Directly predicting individual over-demand stations to carry out preventive measures is difficult, since the bike usage pattern of a station is highly dynamic and context dependent. In addition, the fact that bike usage pattern is affected not only by common contextual factors (e.g., time and weather) but also by opportunistic contextual factors (e.g., social and traffic events) poses a great challenge. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic cluster-based framework for over-demand prediction. Depending on the context, we construct a weighted correlation network to model the relationship among bike stations, and dynamically group neighboring stations with similar bike usage patterns into clusters. We then adopt Monte Carlo simulation to predict the over-demand probability of each cluster. Evaluation results using real-world data from New York City and Washington, D.C. show that our framework accurately predicts over-demand clusters and outperforms the baseline methods significantly.},

In particular, we elaborate on four major components of the platform: (i) curation of reports from heterogeneous data sources; (ii) categorization of individual reports into relevant issues (e.g. bus breakdown) using suitable classification techniques; (iii) aggregation of related reports (in the spatio- temporal sense) to identify specific issues pivoted to distinct city locations; and (iv) verification of issues to ensure reliability of information being provided to the agencies. Janayuja is deployed for the largest public transport agency in Bangalore, India. Based on insights generated by Janayuja, the agency can better manage their current operations, understand and anticipate new requirements from commuters (e.g. for new bus routes) and, in turn, encourage greater usage of a public transportation system.},

abstract = {Cities are composed of complex systems with physical, cyber, and social components. Current works on ex-tracting and understanding city events mainly rely on technology enabled infrastructure to observe and record events. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage citizen observations of various city systems and services such as traffic, public transport, water supply, weather, sewage, and public safety as a source of city events. We investigate the feasibility of using such textual streams for extracting city events from annotated text. We formalize the problem of annotating social streams such as microblogs as a sequence labeling problem. We present a novel training data creation process for training sequence labeling models. Our automatic training data creation process utilizes instance level domain knowledge (e.g., locations in a city, possible event terms). We compare this automated annotation process to a state-of-the-art tool that needs manually created training data and show that it has comparable performance in annotation tasks. An aggregation algorithm is then presented for event extraction from annotated text. We carry out a com-prehensive evaluation of the event annotation and event extraction on a real-world dataset consisting of event reports and tweets collected over four months from San Francisco Bay Area. The evaluation results are promising and provide insights into the utility of social stream for extracting city events.},

abstract = {A social event is an occurrence that involves lots of people and is accompanied by an obvious rise in human flow. Analysis of social events has real-world importance because events bring about impacts on many aspects of city life. Traditionally, detection and impact measurement of social events rely on social investigation, which involves considerable human effort. Recently, by analyzing messages in social networks, researchers can also detect and evaluate country-scale events. Nevertheless, the analysis of city-scale events has not been explored. In this article, we use human flow dynamics, which reflect the social activeness of a region, to detect social events and measure their impacts. We first extract human flow dynamics from taxi traces. Second, we propose a method that can not only discover the happening time and venue of events from abnormal social activeness, but also measure the scale of events through changes in such activeness. Third, we extract traffic congestion information from traces and use its change during social events to measure their impact. The results of experiments validate the effectiveness of both the event detection and impact measurement methods.},

abstract = {Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN) such as Foursquare allow users to indicate venue visits via check-ins. This re- sults inmuch fine grained context-rich data, useful for study- ing user mobility. In this work, we use check-ins to charac- terize trips and visitors to two cities, where visitors are de- fined as having their home cities elsewhere. First, we divide trips into two duration types: long and short. We then show that trip types differ in check-in distributions over venue cat- egories, time slots, as well as check-in intensity. Based on the trip types, we then divide visitors into long-term and short-term visitors. We compare visitor types in terms of popularities of check-in venues and proximities to friends' check-ins. Our findings indicate that short-term visitors are more biased towards popular venues. As for proximity to friends' check-ins, the effect is more consistently observed for long-term visitors. These findings also illustrate that lo- cations of incoming visitors can effectively be analyzed using LBSN data in addition to conducting user surveys which are relatively costlier. Lastly, we investigate the importance of visitor type in- formation in models for venue prediction. We apply mod- els including a state of the art kernel density estimation technique and ranking based on venue popularity. For each model, we consider two settings where visitor type informa- tion is absent/present. For long-term visitors, we observed little differences in accuracies. However, for short-term vis- itors, predictions are significantly more accurate by using type information. These findings suggest that venue predic- tion or recommender systems should consider visitor type to improve accuracy. Categories},

abstract = {Safety is a concern for most urban communities; residents interact in multiple ways with the police to address their safety concerns. Positive interactions with police help residents to feel safe. In developing countries, residents have started to use Online Social Networks (OSN) such as Facebook to share concerns and seek solutions. In this study, we investigate whether residents' post on OSN contain actionable information that police can use to address safety concerns and how residents use OSN to communicate with police. For this, we analyze residents' posts and comments on the Facebook page of Bangalore City Police, India, over a period of one month. Our results show that residents post information (including location) about various crimes such as neighborhood issues (drunkards, illegal construction), financial frauds, property crime, and thefts. In addition to crime, Facebook page gives information on residents' satisfaction and police performance. Majority of residents use police Facebook page to appreciate the good work of police. Police response to residents' post vary from ignore, acknowledge, reply, and follow-up. We find that police respond to most residents' post and help residents to reach the authority who can help solve the issue. Police adopt a formal communication style to interact with residents. We find that in addition to actionable information, OSN can help understand fear of crime among residents and develop mutual accountability between police and residents.},

abstract = {Public transportation systems are flexible and affordable for the passengers. In contrast, the operation and construc- tion of the necessary infrastructure is cost-intensive and re- quires extensive planning. Decisions about the scheduling, capacities and the location of stations are dependent on var- ious economic, social, and environmental factors and have a major impact on the structure of a city. In this context, information about the starting points and destinations of potential passengers is highly relevant for operators. Unfor- tunately, the collection of this data is not trivial and often based on time intensive and expensive studies. In this paper we present a novel approach to gain knowledge for transportation system optimization based on the data of taxi rides, which have been recorded for documentation pur- poses. This data can be analyzed and offers an insight into the fine-grained travel intentions of millions of people. We introduce an interactive web application, which enables the analysis of about 700 millions taxi rides in New York City. Additionally to the exploration of the most frequent travel routes, the application can automatically suggest useful ex- tensions of the exciting transportation system or suggest an optimized route map, which can be used to evaluate the ex- isting one. With this functionality, the presented software effectively supports the decision processes of operators and enables the continuous evaluation of the existing systems},

abstract = {A growing body of literature has been devoted to harnessing the crowdsourcing power of social media by extracting knowledge from the huge amounts of information available online. This paper discusses how social media data can be used indirectly and with minimal cost to extract travel attributes such as trip purpose and activity location. As a result, the capacity of Twitter data in complementing other sources of transport related data such as household travel surveys or traffic count data is examined. Further, a detailed discussion is provided on how short term travellers, such as tourists, can be identified using Twitter data and how their travel pattern can be analysed. Having appropriate information about tourists/visitors – such as the places they visit, their origin and the pattern of their movements at their destination – is of great importance to urban planners. The available profile information of users and self-reported geo-location data on Twitter are used to identify tourists visiting Sydney as well as also those Sydney residents who made a trip outside Sydney. The presented data and analysis enable us to understand and track tourists' movements in cities for better urban planning. The results of this paper open up avenues for travel demand modellers to explore the possibility of using big data (in this case Twitter data) to model short distance (day-to-day or activity based) and long distance (vacation) trips.},

However, with the advent of the Web, a vast amount of structured and unstructured data describing architectural structures has become available publicly. This includes in- formation about the perception and use of buildings (for instance, through social media), and structured informa- tion about the building's features and characteristics (for instance, through public Linked Data). Hence, first min- ing (i) the popularity of buildings from the social Web and (ii) then correlating such rankings with certain features of buildings, can provide an efficient method to identify suc- cessful architectural patterns. In this paper we propose an approach to rank buildings through the automated mining of Flickr metadata. By further correlating such rankings with building properties described in Linked Data we are able to identify popular patterns for particular building types (airports, bridges, churches, halls, and skyscrapers). Our approach combines crowdsourcing with Web mining tech- niques to establish influential factors, as well as ground truth to evaluate our rankings. Our extensive experimental results depict thatmethods tailored to specific structure types allow an accurate measurement of their public perception.},

Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second,we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community.},

abstract = {Measuring socioeconomic deprivation of cities in an accurate and timely fashion has become a priority for governments around the world, as the massive urbanization process we are witnessing is causing high levels of inequalities which require intervention. Traditionally, deprivation indexes have been derived from census data, which is however very expensive to obtain, and thus acquired only every few years. Alternative computational methods have been proposed in recent years to automatically extract proxies of deprivation at a fine spatio-temporal level of granularity; however, they usually require access to datasets (e.g., call details records) that are not publicly available to governments and agencies. To remedy this, we propose a new method to automatically mine deprivation at a fine level of spatio-temporal granularity that only requires access to freely available user-generated content. More precisely, the method needs access to datasets describing what urban elements are present in the physical environment; examples of such datasets are Foursquare and OpenStreetMap. Using these datasets, we quantitatively describe neighborhoods by means of a metric, called {\{}$\backslash$em Offering Advantage{\}}, that reflects which urban elements are distinctive features of each neighborhood. We then use that metric to {\{}$\backslash$em (i){\}} build accurate classifiers of urban deprivation and {\{}$\backslash$em (ii){\}} interpret the outcomes through thematic analysis. We apply the method to three UK urban areas of different scale and elaborate on the results in terms of precision and recall.},

We consider votes from more than 3.3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of location perceptions. We arrange those locations into a graph upon which we learn pleasant routes. Based on a quantitative validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more beautiful, quiet, and happy. To test the generality of our approach, we consider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in Boston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for which we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30 participants in London and 54 in Boston.

abstract = {The problem of identifying the optimal location for a new retail store has been the focus of past research, especially in the field of land economy, due to its importance in the success of a business. Traditional approaches to the problem have factored in demographics, revenue and aggregated human flow statistics from nearby or remote areas. However, the acquisition of relevant data is usually expensive. With the growth of location-based social networks, fine grained data describing user mobility and popularity of places has recently become attainable. In this paper we study the predictive power of various machine learning features on the popularity of retail stores in the city through the use of a dataset collected from Foursquare in New York. The features we mine are based on two general signals: geographic, where features are formulated according to the types and density of nearby places, and user mobility, which includes transitions between venues or the incoming flow of mobile users from distant areas. Our evaluation suggests that the best performing features are common across the three different commercial chains considered in the analysis, although variations may exist too, as explained by heterogeneities in the way retail facilities attract users. We also show that performance improves significantly when combining multiple features in supervised learning algorithms, suggesting that the retail success of a business may depend on multiple factors.},

abstract = {In order to increase the attractiveness of public transport systems, information technology has great potential to add value to their usage. In particular, the availability of digital sources of behavioural transport data opens up new directions for the development of transport information services which are focused on the passengers' engagement in public transport. This will enable novel perceptions of transport services, encompassing aspects of personal transport behaviour - information related to the transport routines of individual travellers, social transport behaviour - information which creates an understanding of the collective transport usage of social groups - And dimensions of quality-of-transport information which include novel measures of travel experiences such as overcrowding. In this paper, we introduce and discuss a design space of how behavioural transport data can shape more user-centric transport information services in order to inform future research activities in this area.

@article{Smith2013,
abstract = {A common metaphor to describe the movement of people within a city is that of blood flowing through the veins of a living organism. We often speak of the 'pulse of the city' when referring to flow patterns we observe. Here we extend this metaphor by hypothesising that by monitoring the flow of people through a city we can assess the city's health, as a nurse takes a patient's heart-rate and blood pressure during a routine health check. Using an automated fare collection dataset of journeys made on the London rail system, we build a classification model that identifies areas of high deprivation as measured by the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, and achieve a precision, sensitivity and specificity of 0.805, 0.733 and 0.810, respectively. We conclude with a discussion of the potential benefits this work provides to city planning, policymaking, and citizen engagement initiatives. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

@article{Macadar2013,
abstract = {This article presents the findings from the first-round analysis of some initiatives in Porto Alegre, capital of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), following the Smart Cities Initiatives Framework from Chourabi et al. In order to do that, secondary data from official websites and other available and reliable information sources are examined. The data collected combined with the framework factors of smart cities provide a faithful overview of the evolution of Porto Alegre as a city searching to be smarter. The objective here is not making a deep analysis of these initiatives. Instead, this paper aims at giving an overview of the several initiatives taking into account the eight factors produced by the members of the Smart Cities and Service Integration Project research team. The findings demonstrate the potential and the needs of further studies into some of these initiatives by using the interview protocol developed and already used in semi-structured interviews made by this group. This preliminary analysis may lead to the conclusion that the city has fully achieved the requirements of a smart city. However, since most of second data come from official sources that could be considered overly positive.},

Two types of content sharing are presented: aggregating existing social media content about particular locations for sharing, and sharing online videos with collocated people at a public urban screen. The paper describes an exploratory study, an observational study, as well as an interpretational study in regards to application usage and user experience. Sharing content on public urban screens can pique the curiosity of users towards collocated people and the application itself resulting in raised awareness of collocated people.},

abstract = {Citizen-participation faces a large number of obstacles. eParticipation is considered to be one of the key tools to ensure effective state-to-citizen communication. A number of initiatives have led to the creation of eParticipation platforms, enabling digital participation online via ICT technologies. Even though these solutions have been introduced, the overall citizen participation remains at a relatively low level, and in general eParticipation objectives have not been fully met. One of the main reasons identified, why the initiatives fall short on participation, is the problem of digital divide and social exclusion. We present a study on eParticipation in municipalities, based on an opinion-mining project in an Irish city. We provide preliminary results and our conclusions after conducting a specific initiative. We identify key factors and decisions that have led towards a promising initiative in the field of eParticipation.},

This project aims at providing a lightweight, technological contribution towards removing the hierarchy between those who build the city and those who use it. We aim to narrow this gap by enhancing people's experience of physical spaces with digital, civic technologies that are directly accessible within that space. This paper presents the findings of a design trial allowing users to interact with a public screen via their mobile phones. The screen facilitated a feedback platform about a concrete urban planning project by promoting specific questions and encouraging direct, in-situ, real-time responses via SMS and twitter. This new mechanism offers additional benefits for civic participation as it gives voice to residents who otherwise would not be heard. It also promotes a positive attitude towards local governments and gathers information different from more traditional public engagement tools.},

Existing industry attempting to bring alternative transportation choices, fall short reaching critical mass to survive. In this work, we focus both on the issues of solo driving and why industry might be falling short understanding the dynamics of commuting preferences. We followed an innovative experience design framework to shape our user centered design processes and identified the underlying dynamics of flexibility, cost and personal preference as three driving themes affecting people's commuting choices. We have then designed and evaluated a concept design for an interactive system that manifested these themes, and reported our findings and design implications on how to facilitate behavioral change through design. Our primary finding is that people's flexibility preferences change when a system offers them concrete scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

@article{Lathia2011,
abstract = {As the public transport infrastructure of large cities expands, transport operators are diversifying the range and prices of tickets that can be purchased for travel. However, selecting the best fare for each individual traveller's needs is a complex process that is left almost completely unaided. By examining the relation between urban mobility and fare purchasing habits in large datasets from London, England's public transport network, we estimate that travellers in the city cumulatively spend, per year, up to approximately GBP 200 million more than they need to, as a result of purchasing the incorrect fares. We propose to address these incorrect purchases by leveraging the huge volumes of data that travellers create as they move about the city, by providing, to each of them, personalised ticket recommendations based on their estimated future travel patterns. In this work, we explore the viability of building a fare-recommendation system for public transport networks by (a) formalising the problem as two separate prediction problems and (b) evaluating a number of algorithms that aim to match travellers to the best fare. We find that applying data mining techniques to public transport data has the potential to provide travellers with substantial savings.},
