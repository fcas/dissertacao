abstract = {The study of disaster events and their impact in the ur-ban space has been traditionally conducted through manual collections and analysis of surveys, questionnaires and au-thority documents. While there have been increasingly rich troves of human behavioral data related to the events of interest, the ability to obtain hindsight following a disas-ter event has not been scaled up. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel approach for analyzing events called PairFac. PairFac utilizes discriminant tensor analysis to automati-cally discover the impact of a major event from rich human behavioral data. Our method aims to (i) uncover the persis-tent patterns across multiple interrelated aspects of urban behavior (e.g., when, where and what citizens do in a city) and at the same time (ii) identify the salient changes follow-ing a potentially impactful event. We show the effectiveness of PairFac in comparison with previous methods through extensive experiments. We also demonstrate the advantages of our approach through case studies with real-world traffic sensor data and social media streams surrounding the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Our work has both methodological contributions in studying the impact of an external stimulus on a system as well as practical implications in the area of disaster event analysis and assessment.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of smartphone apps, socialmedia, and online forums, modern citizens are actively discussing and expressing opinions about city related issues in open public forums on the web. This paper presents a people-centric platform, Janayuja, that can act as an effective conduit between residents and civic agencies, by collecting timely information from different online sources and providing actionable insights to the agencies on pressing city issues. In particular, we elaborate on four major components of the platform: (i) curation of reports from heterogeneous data sources; (ii) categorization of individual reports into relevant issues (e.g. bus breakdown) using suitable classification techniques; (iii) aggregation of related reports (in the spatio- temporal sense) to identify specific issues pivoted to distinct city locations; and (iv) verification of issues to ensure reliability of information being provided to the agencies. Janayuja is deployed for the largest public transport agency in Bangalore, India. Based on insights generated by Janayuja, the agency can better manage their current operations, understand and anticipate new requirements from commuters (e.g. for new bus routes) and, in turn, encourage greater usage of a public transportation system.},

@article{Anantharam2015,
abstract = {Cities are composed of complex systems with physical, cyber, and social components. Current works on ex-tracting and understanding city events mainly rely on technology enabled infrastructure to observe and record events. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage citizen observations of various city systems and services such as traffic, public transport, water supply, weather, sewage, and public safety as a source of city events. We investigate the feasibility of using such textual streams for extracting city events from annotated text. We formalize the problem of annotating social streams such as microblogs as a sequence labeling problem. We present a novel training data creation process for training sequence labeling models. Our automatic training data creation process utilizes instance level domain knowledge (e.g., locations in a city, possible event terms). We compare this automated annotation process to a state-of-the-art tool that needs manually created training data and show that it has comparable performance in annotation tasks. An aggregation algorithm is then presented for event extraction from annotated text. We carry out a com-prehensive evaluation of the event annotation and event extraction on a real-world dataset consisting of event reports and tweets collected over four months from San Francisco Bay Area. The evaluation results are promising and provide insights into the utility of social stream for extracting city events.},

Meanwhile, the rapid growth of multiple social platforms makes it possible to perform a comprehensive user profile learning from different views. However, the research efforts on user profile learning from multiple data sources are still relatively sparse, and there is no large-scale dataset released towards user profile learning. In our study, we contribute such benchmark and perform an initial study on user mobility and demographic profile learning. First, we constructed and released a large-scale multi-source multi-modal dataset from three geographical areas. We then applied our proposed ensemble model on this dataset to learn user profile. Based on our experimental results, we observed that multiple data sources mutually complement each other and their appropriate fusion boosts the user profiling performance.},

The research presented in this paper proposes a preliminary research work that combines semantics processing and machine learning to derive geographic and semantic knowledge implicitly derived from the perceptions and opinions as expressed by social networks, digital media and institutional data. The results are mapped to the geographical structure of the city in order to study differences and commonalities at the neighborhood level. The whole approach is applied and illustrated in the context of the city of Mexico and pollution perception as a case study. The figures that emerge show evidence of a significant impact of the structure of the city over the way citizens perceive pollution.},

@article{Abbasi2015,
abstract = {A growing body of literature has been devoted to harnessing the crowdsourcing power of social media by extracting knowledge from the huge amounts of information available online. This paper discusses how social media data can be used indirectly and with minimal cost to extract travel attributes such as trip purpose and activity location. As a result, the capacity of Twitter data in complementing other sources of transport related data such as household travel surveys or traffic count data is examined. Further, a detailed discussion is provided on how short term travellers, such as tourists, can be identified using Twitter data and how their travel pattern can be analysed. Having appropriate information about tourists/visitors – such as the places they visit, their origin and the pattern of their movements at their destination – is of great importance to urban planners. The available profile information of users and self-reported geo-location data on Twitter are used to identify tourists visiting Sydney as well as also those Sydney residents who made a trip outside Sydney. The presented data and analysis enable us to understand and track tourists' movements in cities for better urban planning. The results of this paper open up avenues for travel demand modellers to explore the possibility of using big data (in this case Twitter data) to model short distance (day-to-day or activity based) and long distance (vacation) trips.},

@article{Zhang2015,
abstract = {A social event is an occurrence that involves lots of people and is accompanied by an obvious rise in human flow. Analysis of social events has real-world importance because events bring about impacts on many aspects of city life. Traditionally, detection and impact measurement of social events rely on social investigation, which involves considerable human effort. Recently, by analyzing messages in social networks, researchers can also detect and evaluate country-scale events. Nevertheless, the analysis of city-scale events has not been explored. In this article, we use human flow dynamics, which reflect the social activeness of a region, to detect social events and measure their impacts. We first extract human flow dynamics from taxi traces. Second, we propose a method that can not only discover the happening time and venue of events from abnormal social activeness, but also measure the scale of events through changes in such activeness. Third, we extract traffic congestion information from traces and use its change during social events to measure their impact. The results of experiments validate the effectiveness of both the event detection and impact measurement methods.},

@article{Chen2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.Bike sharing is booming globally as a green transportation mode, but the occurrence of over-demand stations that have no bikes or docks available greatly affects user experiences. Directly predicting individual over-demand stations to carry out preventive measures is difficult, since the bike usage pattern of a station is highly dynamic and context dependent. In addition, the fact that bike usage pattern is affected not only by common contextual factors (e.g., time and weather) but also by opportunistic contextual factors (e.g., social and traffic events) poses a great challenge. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic cluster-based framework for over-demand prediction. Depending on the context, we construct a weighted correlation network to model the relationship among bike stations, and dynamically group neighboring stations with similar bike usage patterns into clusters. We then adopt Monte Carlo simulation to predict the over-demand probability of each cluster. Evaluation results using real-world data from New York City and Washington, D.C. show that our framework accurately predicts over-demand clusters and outperforms the baseline methods significantly.},

Recommended paths are computed automatically from these data sources by a complementary application of social mining techniques, Bayes algorithm and an adaptation of the Dijkstra algorithm.
