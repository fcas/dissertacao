abstract = {The growing size of cities and increasing population mobility have determined a rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, which has resulted in many challenges for road traffic management authorities in relation to traffic congestion, accidents, and air pollution. Over the recent years, researchers from both industry and academia have been focusing their efforts on exploiting the advances in sensing, communication, and dynamic adaptive technologies to make the existing road traffic management systems (TMSs) more efficient to cope with the aforementioned issues in future smart cities. However, these efforts are still insufficient to build a reliable and secure TMS that can handle the foreseeable rise of population and vehicles in smart cities. In this survey, we present an up-to-date review of the different technologies used in the different phases involved in a TMS and discuss the potential use of smart cars and social media to enable fast and more accurate traffic congestion detection and mitigation. We also provide a thorough study of the security threats that may jeopardize the efficiency of the TMS and endanger drivers' lives. Furthermore, the most significant and recent European and worldwide projects dealing with traffic congestion issues are briefly discussed to highlight their contribution to the advancement of smart transportation. Finally, we discuss some open challenges and present our own vision to develop robust TMSs for future smart cities.},

People are now sharing their experiences and views in blogs, micro-blogs, comments, photos, videos, and other postings in social sites. It has been recognized that timely reactions to public opinions and sentiments and its proper use by city governments are of paramount importance to their missions. Despite of the widely recognized potential of sentiment analysis, relatively little is known about how to best harness its potential benefits for smart cities. The objective of this article is to help fill the void by reviewing the state of the art and opportunities of data sources and applications of sentiment analysis for smart cities. Additionally, The article explores deep features of photos shared by users in Twitter via transfer learning. Thus revealing interesting research opportunities and applications.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature in social science has been devoted to extracting new information from social media to assist authorities in manage crowd projects. In this paper geolocation (or spatial) based information provided in social media is investigated to utilize intelligent transportation services. Further, the general trend of travel activities during weekdays is studied. For this purpose, a dataset consisting of more than 40,000 tweets in south and west part of the Sydney metropolitan area is utilized. After a data processing effort, the tweets are clustered into seven main categories using text mining techniques, where each category represents a type of activity including shopping, recreation, and work. Unlike the previous studies in this area, the focus of this work is on the content of the tweets rather than only using geotagged data or sentiment analysis. Beside activity type, temporal and spatial distributions of activities are used in the classification exercise. Categories are mapped to the identified regions within the city of Sydney across four time slots (two peak periods and two off-peak periods). Each time slot is used to construct a network with nodes represnting people, activities and locations and edges reflecting the association between the nodes. The constructed networks are used to study the trend of activities/locations in a typical working day. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

Understanding the movement of people and their spatial trajectorits would greatly aid the development of policies for sustainable urban living including urban traffic analysis and smart city management. Due to the widespread popularity of mobile devices with location-aware capabilities and the extensive prevalence of location-based social networks, citizens' movements and their trajectories are being produced and gathered at an unprecedented rate. In this context, there are two fundamental issues that need to be addressed: trajectory data hold private information of citizens that require privacy preserving solutions for data release and analysis, and the heterogeneous nature of the trajectory data makes it hard to effectively measure their similarity, which is fundamental to trajectory analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing an innovative private trajectories calibration model that not only guarantees the privacy of citizens, but also increases the utility. We have conducted comprehensive experiments using real-life user trajectories extracted from Twitter data. The results reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, which is also reported in this paper.},

Travel-intensive events have the potential to increase the capacities for existing routes or to offer new connections. Actually, planning activities of vendors are mainly based on past-data. To improve the quality of predictions about future capacities, information from different data sources e.g. social media, geo-based information or websites has to be considered. Technologies to collect structured and unstructured information from different data sources are available. This paper presents an approach to use these technologies for capacity predictions and pricing of coach vendors in terms of travel-intensive events. To verify the approach, a case study, focused on the UEFA EURO 2016, is described. The case study is necessary to demonstrate the value of the research and to give a deeper understanding about data sources and the discussion culture of travelers in social networks.},

abstract = {— Subway passenger flow prediction is strategically important in metro transit system management. The prediction under event occurrences turns into a very challenging task. In this paper, we adopt a new kind of data source—social media— to tackle this challenge. We develop a systematic approach to examine social media activities and sense event occurrences. Our initial analysis demonstrates that there exists a moderate positive correlation between passenger flow and the rates of social media posts. This finding motivates us to develop a novel approach for improved flow forecast. We first develop a hashtag-based event detection algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a parametric and convex optimization-based approach, called optimization and prediction with hybrid loss function (OPL), to fuse the linear regression and the results of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model jointly. The OPL hybrid model takes advantage of the unique strengths of linear correlation in social media features and SARIMA model in time series prediction. Experiments on events nearby a subway station show that OPL reports the best forecasting performance compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. In addition, an ensemble model is developed to leverage the weighted results from OPL and support vector machine regression together. As a result, the prediction accuracy and the robustness further increase.},

abstract = {Public transport users are increasingly connected in real time through mobile devices to social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. This allows them both to access and to provide valuable operational and emotional information from and to fellow travellers. Transport network management could benefit from this exchange, and also participate by providing rewards to valuable contributors. This paper introduces a model for such cooperative exchanges of information and proposes a valuation system for the information provided and obtained. Users and automatic systems (sensors) would provide information, such as punctuality, noise levels, and assessments of driver's skills, referenced to particular vehicles, routes and times. Then other users accessing such information would classify it on the level of correctness and usefulness, under a validation scheme operated by the transport network management. Such information could either be openly available or private in some degree within a social network, taking account of security aspects that need to be preserved. In a mature environment, more valuable information could only be made available via subscription or freely available to highly valued contributing users. The use of social networks would provide an easy way of sharing information and also provide a sense of community to the involved travellers. Transport network management benefiting from relevant information exchanges could reward users contributing with valuable data, as an incentive to enhance participation. In this context, the information exchanged would achieve a real transactional value and present a new electronic commerce paradigm. Overall, such exchange could also be seen as a serious game.},

abstract = {The demographics and landscape of cities are changing rapidly, and there is an emphasis to better understand the factors which influence citizen happiness in order to design smarter urban systems. Few studies have attempted to understand how large-scale sentiment maps to urban human geography. Inferring sentiment from social media data is one such scalable solution. In this paper, we apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to 0.4 million geo-tagged Tweets in the Greater London area to understand the influence of socioeconomic and urban geography parameters on happiness. Our results not only verify established thinking: that job opportunities correlate with positive sentiments; but also reveal two insights: (1) happiness is negatively correlated with number of children, and (2) happiness has a U-shaped (parabolic) relationship with access to public transportation. The latter implies that the happiest people are those who have good access to public transport, or such poor access that they use private transportation. The number of jobs, children, and transportation availability are every day facets of urban living and individually account for up to 47{\%} of the variations in people's happiness. Our results show that they influence happiness more significantly than long term socioeconomic parameters such as degradation, education, income, housing, and crime. This study will enable urban planners and system designers to move beyond the traditional cost-benefit methodology and to incorporate citizens' happiness. {\&}copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cities are not identical and evolve over time, and sensing in large scale can be used to capture these differences. Research in Wireless Sensor Networks has provided several tools, techniques and algorithms to solve the problem of sensing in restricted scenarios (e.g., factory). However, sensing large scale areas, such as big cities, brings many challenges and incurs high costs related to system building and management. Thus, sensing those areas becomes more feasible when people collaborate among themselves using their portable devices, and building what has been named participatory sensing systems. This work analyzes an emerging type of network derived from this type of system, the Participatory Sensor Network (PSN), where nodes are autonomous mobile entities and the sensing depends on whether they want to participate in the sensing process. Based on four datasets of participatory sensing systems (27 million of records), we show that this type of network brings many challenges related to structural problems, e.g. instant coverage very limited, and also because of big data issues, which may restrict the use of this emerging type of network. However, it presents also, as shown here, many advantages and open opportunities, mainly related to large scale study of cities dynamics.},

Existing work on urban visual analytics is categorized into two classes based on different outputs of such combinations: 1) For data exploration and pattern interpretation, we describe representative visual analytics tools designed for better insights of different types of urban data. 2) For visual learning, we discuss how visualization can help in three major steps of automated analytical approaches (i.e. cohort construction; feature selection {\&} model construction; result evaluation {\&} tuning) for a more effective machine learning or data mining process, leading to sort of artificial intelligence, such as a classifier, a predictor or a regression model. Finally, we outlook the future of urban visual analytics, and conclude the survey with potential research directions.},

abstract = {The proliferation of sensor and actuator networks in the urban environment is directly associated with an increasing volume of data, relating to various aspects of the city. Synchronously, the heterogeneity of data formats, sensory observations, measuring capabilities and accompanying contextual information is substantially growing. Aggregating immense amounts of data feeds from different networks is not necessarily sufficient for providing a better understanding about the processes taking place in the city. Instead, it is essential to extract knowledge patterns that are correlated and integrated in meaningful stories about the urban environment. In light of this new dimension of reality, the OntoPolis{\textcopyright} project proposes an open participatory platform with the aim of allowing citizens and policy makers to assess key performance indicators (KPIs), pertinent to environmental conditions, energy consumption and mobility issues. To achieve this, the system links Semantic Web technologies and standard data encodings with diverse sensor networks that employ both technical devices and human agents. By embodying such methods in the urban design process, the project seeks to break new ground in the emerging fields of data-driven urbanism and urban informatics, towards the development of intelligent city environments. This paper introduces the conceptual and technical underpinnings of OntoPolis{\textcopyright}, exemplifying the environmental-indicators case scenario.},

abstract = {Increasing availability of big data, which doc- uments human activity in space and time, offers new so- lutions to well-known operational problems. Recent studies have demonstrated how topological community detection in large-scale networks of human interactions and mobility can produce geographically cohesive regions, which are meaningful for the regional division of countries. So far, those networks have mainly been built based on the country-wide datasets of telephone calls, typically available for residents of a country. However, it is natural to expect that foreign visitors explore a country in a different way, with patterns that vary depending on nationality. Understanding those differences can be of a great importance for the touristic industry and transportation planning. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of a new type of extensive data, namely bank card transactions executed in a variety of businesses by the domestic and foreign customers of a Spanish bank. We confirm applicability of this data to the regional delineation inline with other datasets and reveal new opportunities related to the distinction of customers by their origin. We point out the important differences between the optimal regional structure derived from the mobility of residents and of foreign visitors. The definition of the mobility network appears to be a crucial component of the methodology, and is potentially sensitive to the dataset being used. While a reasonable comparison of results obtained based on different data of course requires the consistency of such definition. We propose a novel, consistent way of constructing mobility networks using transactional data; a way transposable to a variety of other datasets. Finally, we perform a quantitative study of the impact of tourists' nationality on their mobility behavior. We find a surprisingly consistent trend between the distance from a given country to Spain, and the mobility characteristics of visitors coming from this country, i.e. the parameters of the gravity model estimation.},

abstract = {Public transport smartcard data can be used for detection of large crowds. By comparing statistics on habitual behavior (e.g., average by time of day), one can specifically iden- tify nonhabitual crowds, which are often very problematic for transport systems.While habitual overcrowding (e.g., peak hour) is well understood both by traffic managers and travelers, non- habitual overcrowding hotspots can become even more disruptive and unpleasant because they are generally unexpected. By quickly understanding such cases, a transport manager can react and mitigate transport system disruptions.We propose a probabilistic data analysis model that breaks each nonhabitual overcrowding hotspot into a set of explanatory components. The potential ex- planatory components are initially retrieved from social networks and special events websites and then processed through text- analysis techniques. Finally, for each such component, the prob- abilistic model estimates a specific share in the total overcrowding counts. We first validate with synthetic data and then test our model with real data from the public transport system (EZLink) of Singapore, focused on three case study areas. We demonstrate that it is able to generate explanations that are intuitively plausible and consistent both locally (correlation coefficient, i.e., CC, from 85{\%} to 99{\%} for the three areas) and globally (CC from 41.2{\%} to 83.9{\%}).

A methodology for analyzing the state of the art regarding the application of these systems is proposed in a form of a systematic literature review, by identifying and systematizing possible transportation network performance metrics that can be calculated or predicted using GPS-based AVL systems and inferring tendencies observed throughout the literature regarding techniques used and sensor data source and usage. As a result of this research, several performance metrics were identified, with Travel Time and Average Speed being the most recurrent ones. The conclusions reveal an increase in the number of publications and research projects regarding this topic over the years, as well as a promising potential of this type of technology, with buses and taxis being the most used probe vehicles.},

Mobile device users usually store and use multimedia contents based on their personal interests and preferences. Mobile device challenges such as storage limitation have, however, introduced the problem of mobile multimedia overload to users. To tackle this problem, researchers have developed various techniques that recommend multimedia for mobile users. In this paper, we examine the importance of mobile multimedia recommendation systems from the perspective of three smart communities, namely mobile social learning, mobile event guide, and context-aware services. A cautious analysis of existing research reveals that the implementation of proactive, sensor-based and hybrid recommender systems can improve mobile multimedia recommendations. Nevertheless, there are still challenges and open issues such as the incorporation of context and social properties, which need to be tackled to generate accurate and trustworthy mobile multimedia recommendations.},

Professional communication in terms of usable passenger information systems can make valuable contributions in this context. These systems are promising means to increase passenger comfort and also user acceptance. This paper presents an empirical study, which is the first step of a larger project dealing with the design of an intermodal passenger information system. The study itself deals with stakeholders' feedback about the quality of existing passenger information to identify information gaps, shortcomings in visualization and potential for innovation. 15 bus drivers and service clerks were interviewed. The data was interlaced with results from an earlier passenger survey. It was found that passengers appreciate self-service applications for informational, and particularly for confirmatory reasons. Thus, the benefit of using passenger information systems must be increased, which could be achieved by implementing further features such as social media. Finally, trust-related aspects have to be explored in future studies.},

Starting from this pillar, we investigate perspectives on next-generation vehicles under the assumption of social networking for vehicular applications (i.e., safety and entertainment applications). This paper plays a role as a starting point about socially inspired vehicles andmainly related applications, aswell as communication techniques.Vehicular communications can be considered the “first social network for automobiles” since each driver can share data with other neighbors. For instance, heavy traffic is a common occurrence in some areas on the roads (e.g., at intersections, taxi loading/unloading areas, and so on); as a consequence, roads become a popular social place for vehicles to connect to each other. Human factors are then involved in vehicular ad hoc net- works, not only due to the safety-related applications but also for entertainment purposes. Social characteristics and human behavior largely impact on vehicular ad hoc networks, and this arises to the vehicular social networks, which are formed when vehicles (individuals) “socialize” and share common interests. In this paper,we provide a survey onmain features of vehicular social networks, from novel emerging technologies to social aspects used for mobile applications, as well as main issues and challenges. Vehicular social networks are described as decentralized oppor- tunistic communication networks formed among vehicles. They exploit mobility aspects, and basics of traditional social networks,in order to create novel approaches ofmessage exchange through the detection of dynamic social structures. An overview of the main state-of-the-art on safety and entertainment applications relying on social networking solutions is also provided.},

Activity detection is applied to the mobile phone's accelerometer data to differentiate between two user states (walking vs. non-walking), which are then used to determine vehicle transfers along the journey.

Smart cities harness the power of data from sensors in order to understand and manage city systems. The most important of these sensing devices are smartphones as they provide the most important means to connect the smart city systems with its citizens, allowing personalization n and co-creation. The battery lifetime of smartphones is one of the most important parameters in achieving good user experience for the device. Therefore, the management and optimization of handheld device applications in relation to their power consumption is an important area of research. This paper investigates the relationship between the energy consumption of a localization application and the strength of the GPS signal. This is an important focus because location based applications are among the top power-hungry applications. We conduct experiments on two android location based applications, one developed by us, and the other one, off the shelf. We use the results from the measurements of the two applications to derive a mathematical model that describes the power consumption in smartphones in terms of SNR and the TTFF (Time To First Fix). The results from this study show that higher SNR values of GPS signals do consume less energy while low GPS signals causing faster battery drain (38{\%} as compared to 13{\%}). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a quantitative understanding of how the poor strength (SNR) of satellite signals will cause relatively higher power drain from a smartphone's battery.},

abstract = {Recent mobility scaling research, using new data sources, often relies on aggregated data alone. Hence, these studies face difficulties characterizing the influence of factors such as transportation mode on mobility patterns. This paper attempts to complement this research by looking at a category-rich mobility data set. In order to shed light on the impact of categories, as a case study, we use conventionally collected German mobility data. In contrast to `check-in'-based data, our results are not biased by Euclidean distance approximations. In our analysis, we show that aggregation can hide crucial differences between trip length distributions, when subdivided by categories. For example, we see that on an urban scale (0 to {\~{}}15 km), walking, versus driving, exhibits a highly different scaling exponent, thus universality class. Moreover, mode share and trip length are responsive to day-of-week and time-of-day. For example, in Germany, although driving is relatively less frequent on Sundays than on Wednesdays, trips seem to be longer. In addition, our work may shed new light on the debate between distance-based and intervening-opportunity mechanisms affecting mobility patterns, since mode may be chosen both according to trip length and urban form.},

In this paper, we based on the signaling data and location data coming from one of Chinese main operator's customers, trying to analysis the law that with the increase of users in a district, how their demand for energy change. Through the use of the law, operators can make a basis when conducting the construction of the base station at the time of city expansion and the redundancy phenomenon of construction of base station can be effectively reduced and then make contributions to energy saving, the law can also be used to provide a reference for city Planning Bureau when they conducting the urban planning and the construction of Green city and then get the purpose of optimal allocation of resources. In our study, we carry out the statistics of 1558053 users from Chongqing city, finally we found that with the increase of customer' number of each special district, the number of total traffic in the city present a change of power function},

abstract = {Smart cities have rapidly become a hot topic within technology communities, and promise both improved delivery of services to end users and reduced environmental impact in an era of unprecedented urbanization. Both large hightech companies and grassroots citizen-led initiatives have begun exploring the potential of these technologies. Significant barriers remain to the successful rollout and deployment of business models outlined for smart city applications and services, however. Most of these barriers pertain to an ongoing battle between two main schools of thought for system architecture, ICT and telecommunications, proposed for data management and service creation. Both of these system architectures represent a certain type of value chain and the legacy perspective of the respective players that wish to enter the smart city arena. Smart cities services, however, utilize components of both the ICT industry and mobile telecommunications industries, and do not benefit from the current binary perspective of system architecture. The business models suggested for the development of smart cities require a longterm strategic view of system architecture evolution. This article discusses the architectural evolution required to ensure that the rollout and deployment of smart city technologies is smooth through acknowledging and integrating the strengths of both the system architectures proposed.},

In particular, the analysis is focused on the study of the reliability of public transport services that connect the most important urban centers and the airport of a low density region. The intention is to suggest transport demand management policies aimed at shifting the modal split towards public transport modes as sustainable forms of mobility, encouraging intermodality. In order to determine average travel times and the standard deviation of travel times a specific statistical analysis has been carried out. The results of this analysis have been imported into a GIS package for a further investigation of the services reliability to highlight some critical aspects and adopt specific policies and opportune solutions.},

abstract = {Supporting real-time, cost-effective execution of Complex Event processing applications in the cloud has been an important goal for many scientists in recent years. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) have been widely adopted by major computing companies as a powerful approach for large-scale Complex Event processing (CEP). However, determining the appropriate degree of parallelism of the DSPS' components can be particularly challenging as the volume of data streams is becoming increasingly large, the rule set is becoming continuously complex, and the system must be able to handle such large data stream volumes in real-time, taking into consideration changes in the burstiness levels and data characteristics. In this paper we describe our solution to building elastic complex event processing systems on top of our distributed CEP system which combines two commonly used frameworks, Storm and Esper, in order to provide both ease of usage and scalability. Our approach makes the following contributions: (i) we provide a mechanism for predicting the load and latency of the Esper engines in upcoming time windows, and (ii) we propose a novel algorithm for automatically adjusting the number of engines to use in the upcoming windows, taking into account the cost and the performance gains of possible changes. Our detailed experimental evaluation with a real traffic monitoring application that analyzes bus traces from the city of Dublin indicates the benefits in the working of our approach. Our proposal outperforms the current state of the art technique in regards to the amount of tuples that it can process by four orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Today's citizens and city administrations have an increasing interest in monitoring the air quality in urban areas. Studying the causes of air pollution entails analyzing the correlations between heterogeneous data, among which pollutant concentrations, traffic flow measurements, and meteorological data. To this end, innovative data analytics solutions able to acquire, integrate, and analyze very large amounts of data are needed. This paper presents a new data mining system, named GEneralized Correlation analyzer of pOllution data (GECKO), to discover interesting and multiple-level correlations among a large variety of open air pollution-related data. Specifically, correlations among pollutant levels and traffic and climate conditions are discovered and analyzed at different abstraction levels. The knowledge extraction process is driven by a taxonomy to generalize low-level measurement values as the corresponding categories. To ease the manual inspection of the result, the extracted correlations are classified into few classes based on the semantics of underlying data. The experiments, performed on real data acquired in a major Italian Smart City, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed analytics engine in discovering correlations among pollutant data that are potentially useful for supporting city administrators in decision-making.},

abstract = {Increasingly over the last decade, there has been attention and expectations on the role that ICT solutions can play in increasing accountability, participation and transparency in the Public Administration. Also, attention to citizen participation is more and more at the center of the debate about Smart Cities. However technological solutions have been often proposed without considering first citizens needs and the sociotechnical misalignment within the city, i.e. in peripheral area. The paper outlines the design and implementation process of a wegovernment IT tool, called MiraMap. The project has been developed in the Mirafiori District in Torino (Italy), a neighbourhood which is characterized by problems of marginality and by several undergoing urban transformations with a very high potential for social and economic development in the next few years. This makes Mirafiori Sud a valuable case study environment to experiment new methods and IT solutions to strengthen connection between citizens and public administration. The object of MiraMap, indeed, is to facilitate communication and management between citizens and administration in reporting of issues and claims but also in submitting proposals. Collecting and handling this information in an efficient way is crucial to improve the quality of life in urban suburbs, addressing more targeted and better performed public policies. In order to achieve those results, the authors combined First Life, a new local social network based on an interactive map - with a Business Process Management (BPM) system for easing reports about claims and proposals to be handled. The research process involves an interdisciplinary team, composed by architects, computer scientists, engineers, geographers, legal experts, with the direct participation of local administrators and citizens.},

abstract = {Ride-sharing practice represents one of the possible answers to the traffic congestion problem in today's cities. In this scenario, recommenders aim to determine similarity among different paths with the aim of suggesting possible ride shares. In this paper, we propose a novel dissimilarity function between pairs of paths based on the construction of a shared path, which visits all points of the two paths by respecting the order of sequences within each of them. The shared path is computed as the shortest path on a directed acyclic graph with precedence constraints between the points of interest defined in the single paths. The dissimilarity function evaluates how much a user has to extend his/her path for covering the overall shared path. After computing the dissimilarity between any pair of paths, we execute a fuzzy relational clustering algorithm for determining groups of similar paths. Within these groups, the recommenders will choose users who can be invited to share rides. We show and discuss the results obtained by our approach on 45 paths.},

abstract = {Characterized by using minimum hard (structural) and soft (computational) resources, a novel parameter-free mini- mal resource neural network (MRNN) framework is proposed for solving a wide range of single-source shortest path (SP) problems for various graph types. The problems are the k- shortest time path problems with any combination of three constraints: time, hop, and label constraints, and the graphs can be directed, undirected, or bidirected with symmetric and/or asymmetric traversal time, which can be real and time dependent. Isomorphic to the graph where the SP is to be sought, the network is activated by generating autowave at source neuron and the autowave travels automatically along the paths with the speed of a hop in an iteration. Properties of the network are studied, algorithms are presented, and computation complexity is analyzed. The framework guarantees globally optimal solutions of a series of problems during the iteration process of the network, which provides insight into why even the SP is still too long to be satisfied. The network facilitates very large scale integrated circuit implementation and adapt to very large scale problems due to its massively parallel processing and minimum resource utilization. When implemented in a sequentially process- ing computer, experiments on synthetic graphs, road maps of cities of the USA, and vehicle routing with time windows indicate that theMRNN is especially efficient for large scale sparse graphs and even dense graphs with some constraints, e.g., the CPU time taken and the iteration number used for the road maps of cities of the USA is even less than ∼2{\%} and 0.5{\%}that of the Dijkstra's algorithm.},

To facilitate mobile Internet connectivity for travellers using these lines we designed DeepOpp, a context- aware system that enables offline access to social media content. This access is achieved by prefetching and caching content when connectivity opportunities (such as urban 3G or station WiFi) arise. DeepOpp can measure signal characteristics (strength, bandwidth and latency) and based on current and historical information make signal coverage predictions in order to activate data prefetching of social media content. An Android-based implementation of DeepOpp has enabled us to carry out real tests on the London underground and demonstrate its benefits which promote it as a viable solution for cities with similar metro systems such as New York, Paris and Shanghai.},

abstract = {Mitigating vandalism in local traffic and at stations, violent disorder, and theft by employing security guards, installing video cameras are expensive and only partially solve existing the problems. Related costs directly affect the fares and thus the attractiveness of local public transport. We discuss a concept to implement a Report-service to forward emergency and complaint messages in local public transport. The service is based on a mobile application and a message routing system. The aim is to increase travel safety and the attractiveness of the local public transport. On the base of theoretical approaches and the usage of paper prototypes we show the possibilities how such a Report-service could be implemented},

abstract = {Smart devices are supporting emerging types of location-based gaming applications to attain collaborations among collocated users in public places like transports. However, they are facing many challenges like the timely performance of back-end game servers for runtime game operation, unreliable cellular network connections, and opportunistic and dynamic local environment. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose {\&}{\#}x201C;CrowdMoG{\&}{\#}x201D;, a Crowd based Mobile Gaming platform, to identify and match the nearby passengers on the move according to their associated gaming preferences, and provides the smooth session handoff to enable the continuity of existing game plays when participants leave the game due to different mobility patterns. We therefore describe the potential, along with challenges and opportunities that open up the new dimension for the entire research community to redesign and examine a tradition problem, fundamentally transforming it into a new era of mobile gaming experience.},

@article{Eiza2015,
abstract = {Given the plethora of individual preferences and requirements of public transport passengers for travel, seating, catering, etc., it becomes very challenging to tailor generic services to individuals' requirements using the existing service platforms. As tens of thousands of sensors have been already deployed along roadsides and rail tracks and on buses and trains in many countries, it is expected that the introduction of IP networking will revolutionise the functionality of public transport in general and rail services in particular. In this paper, we propose a new communication paradigm to improve rail services and address the requirement of rail service users: the Rail Internet of Things (RIoT). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to define the RIoT and design an architectural platform that includes its components and the data communication channels. Moreover, we develop an assured requirements model using the situation calculus modelling to represent the fundamental requirements for adjustable, decentralised feedback control mechanisms necessary for the RIoT-ready software systems. The developed formal model is applied to demonstrate the design of passenger assistance software that interacts with the RIoT ecosystem and provides passengers with real-time information that is tailored to their requirements with runtime adaptability.},

@article{Noulas2013,
abstract = {Inferring the type of activities in neighborhoods of urban centers may be helpful in a number of contexts including urban planning, content delivery and activity recommendations for mobile web users or may even yield to a deeper understanding of the geographical evolution of social life in the city . During the past few years, the analysis of mobile phone usage patterns, or of social media with longitudinal attributes, have aided the automatic characterization of the dynamics of the urban environment. In this work, we combine a dataset sourced from a telecom- munication provider in Spain with a database of millions of geo- tagged venues from Foursquare and we formulate the problem of urban activity inference in a supervised learning framework. In particular, we exploit user communication patterns observed at the base station level in order to predict the activity of Foursquare users who checkin-in at nearby venues. First, we mine a set of machine learning features that allow us to encode the input telecommunication signal of a tower. Subsequently, we evaluate a diverse set of supervised learning algorithms using labels extracted from Foursquare place categories and we consider two application scenarios. Initially, we assess how hard it is to predict specific urban activity of an area, showing that Nightlife and Entertainment spots are those easier to infer, whereas College and Shopping areas are those featuring the lowest accuracy rates. Then, considering a candidate set of activity types in a geographic area, we aim to elect the most prominent one. We demonstrate how the difficulty of the problem increases with the number of classes incorporated in the prediction task, yet the classifiers achieve a considerably better performance compared to a random guess},

@article{Caiati2016,
abstract = {Real-world data are key to the implementation and validation of urban transport models, and their availability and accuracy can dramatically affect the reliability of the resulting estimates. This paper discusses the potential of open data as a mean to gain insights in urban mobility, so as to supplement traditional methodologies that are often complex and expensive. We propose a methodology –fully based on publicly accessi- ble data– for the development of Origin-Destination Matrices (ODMs). The methodology uses as input (i) a baseline morning- peak-hour ODM and (ii) road traffic count data. We test our proposed approach in a real-world case study, i.e., the city of Bologna, Italy. We also employ open geospatial data, from socio- economic sources, to validate the ODMs, and find that these reproduce the typical urban travel demand profile in the target city during a whole day. Our results demonstrate the suitability of the methodology for transport policy design and urban planning. We also discuss current difficulties of gathering open data and the lessons learned when attempting to leverage such data.},

We provide a thorough review of the multidisciplinary activities that rely on mobile traffic datasets, identifying major categories and sub-categories in the literature, so as to outline a hierarchical classification of research lines. When detailing the works pertaining to each class, we balance a comprehensive view of state-of- the-art results with punctual focuses on the methodological aspects. Our approach provides a complete introductory guide to the research based onmobile traffic analysis. It allows summarizing themain findings of the current state-of-the-art, as well as pinpointing important open research directions.},
