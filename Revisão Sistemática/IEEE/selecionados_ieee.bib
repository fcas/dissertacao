abstract = {Cities are not identical and evolve over time, and sensing in large scale can be used to capture these differences. Research in Wireless Sensor Networks has provided several tools, techniques and algorithms to solve the problem of sensing in restricted scenarios (e.g., factory). However, sensing large scale areas, such as big cities, brings many challenges and incurs high costs related to system building and management. Thus, sensing those areas becomes more feasible when people collaborate among themselves using their portable devices, and building what has been named participatory sensing systems. This work analyzes an emerging type of network derived from this type of system, the Participatory Sensor Network (PSN), where nodes are autonomous mobile entities and the sensing depends on whether they want to participate in the sensing process. Based on four datasets of participatory sensing systems (27 million of records), we show that this type of network brings many challenges related to structural problems, e.g. instant coverage very limited, and also because of big data issues, which may restrict the use of this emerging type of network. However, it presents also, as shown here, many advantages and open opportunities, mainly related to large scale study of cities dynamics.},

abstract = {The demographics and landscape of cities are changing rapidly, and there is an emphasis to better understand the factors which influence citizen happiness in order to design smarter urban systems. Few studies have attempted to understand how large-scale sentiment maps to urban human geography. Inferring sentiment from social media data is one such scalable solution. In this paper, we apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to 0.4 million geo-tagged Tweets in the Greater London area to understand the influence of socioeconomic and urban geography parameters on happiness. Our results not only verify established thinking: that job opportunities correlate with positive sentiments; but also reveal two insights: (1) happiness is negatively correlated with number of children, and (2) happiness has a U-shaped (parabolic) relationship with access to public transportation. The latter implies that the happiest people are those who have good access to public transport, or such poor access that they use private transportation. The number of jobs, children, and transportation availability are every day facets of urban living and individually account for up to 47{\%} of the variations in people's happiness. Our results show that they influence happiness more significantly than long term socioeconomic parameters such as degradation, education, income, housing, and crime. This study will enable urban planners and system designers to move beyond the traditional cost-benefit methodology and to incorporate citizens' happiness. {\&}copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {The growing size of cities and increasing population mobility have determined a rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, which has resulted in many challenges for road traffic management authorities in relation to traffic congestion, accidents, and air pollution. Over the recent years, researchers from both industry and academia have been focusing their efforts on exploiting the advances in sensing, communication, and dynamic adaptive technologies to make the existing road traffic management systems (TMSs) more efficient to cope with the aforementioned issues in future smart cities. However, these efforts are still insufficient to build a reliable and secure TMS that can handle the foreseeable rise of population and vehicles in smart cities. In this survey, we present an up-to-date review of the different technologies used in the different phases involved in a TMS and discuss the potential use of smart cars and social media to enable fast and more accurate traffic congestion detection and mitigation. We also provide a thorough study of the security threats that may jeopardize the efficiency of the TMS and endanger drivers' lives. Furthermore, the most significant and recent European and worldwide projects dealing with traffic congestion issues are briefly discussed to highlight their contribution to the advancement of smart transportation. Finally, we discuss some open challenges and present our own vision to develop robust TMSs for future smart cities.},

In this paper geolocation (or spatial) based information provided in social media is investigated to utilize intelligent transportation services. Further, the general trend of travel activities during weekdays is studied. For this purpose, a dataset consisting of more than 40,000 tweets in south and west part of the Sydney metropolitan area is utilized. After a data processing effort, the tweets are clustered into seven main categories using text mining techniques, where each category represents a type of activity including shopping, recreation, and work. Unlike the previous studies in this area, the focus of this work is on the content of the tweets rather than only using geotagged data or sentiment analysis. Beside activity type, temporal and spatial distributions of activities are used in the classification exercise. Categories are mapped to the identified regions within the city of Sydney across four time slots (two peak periods and two off-peak periods). Each time slot is used to construct a network with nodes represnting people, activities and locations and edges reflecting the association between the nodes. The constructed networks are used to study the trend of activities/locations in a typical working day. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

In this survey, we first summarize frequently used data types in urban visual analytics, and then elaborate on existing visualization techniques for time, locations and other properties of urban data. Furthermore, we discuss how visualization can be combined with automated analytical approaches. Existing work on urban visual analytics is categorized into two classes based on different outputs of such combinations: 1) For data exploration and pattern interpretation, we describe representative visual analytics tools designed for better insights of different types of urban data. 2) For visual learning, we discuss how visualization can help in three major steps of automated analytical approaches (i.e. cohort construction; feature selection {\&} model construction; result evaluation {\&} tuning) for a more effective machine learning or data mining process, leading to sort of artificial intelligence, such as a classifier, a predictor or a regression model.

Highly dense and complicated networks in the transportation systems propagate confusion in the network because they offer various possible transfer routes to passengers. Visualization is one of the most important techniques for examining such cascades of unusual situations in the huge networks. This paper proposes visual integration of traffic analysis and social media analysis using two forms of big data: smart card data on the Tokyo Metro and social media data on Twitter. Our system provides multiple coordinated views to visually, intuitively, and simultaneously explore changes in passengers' behavior and abnormal situations extracted from smart card data and situational explanations from real voices of passengers such as complaints about services extracted from social media data. We demonstrate the possibilities and usefulness of our novel visualization environment using a series of real data case studies and domain experts' feedbacks about various kinds of events.},

abstract = {â€” Subway passenger flow prediction is strategically important in metro transit system management. The prediction under event occurrences turns into a very challenging task. In this paper, we adopt a new kind of data sourceâ€”social mediaâ€” to tackle this challenge. We develop a systematic approach to examine social media activities and sense event occurrences. Our initial analysis demonstrates that there exists a moderate positive correlation between passenger flow and the rates of social media posts. This finding motivates us to develop a novel approach for improved flow forecast. We first develop a hashtag-based event detection algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a parametric and convex optimization-based approach, called optimization and prediction with hybrid loss function (OPL), to fuse the linear regression and the results of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model jointly. The OPL hybrid model takes advantage of the unique strengths of linear correlation in social media features and SARIMA model in time series prediction. Experiments on events nearby a subway station show that OPL reports the best forecasting performance compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. In addition, an ensemble model is developed to leverage the weighted results from OPL and support vector machine regression together. As a result, the prediction accuracy and the robustness further increase.},

This allows them both to access and to provide valuable operational and emotional information from and to fellow travellers. Transport network management could benefit from this exchange, and also participate by providing rewards to valuable contributors. This paper introduces a model for such cooperative exchanges of information and proposes a valuation system for the information provided and obtained. Users and automatic systems (sensors) would provide information, such as punctuality, noise levels, and assessments of driver's skills, referenced to particular vehicles, routes and times. Then other users accessing such information would classify it on the level of correctness and usefulness, under a validation scheme operated by the transport network management. Such information could either be openly available or private in some degree within a social network, taking account of security aspects that need to be preserved. In a mature environment, more valuable information could only be made available via subscription or freely available to highly valued contributing users. The use of social networks would provide an easy way of sharing information and also provide a sense of community to the involved travellers. Transport network management benefiting from relevant information exchanges could reward users contributing with valuable data, as an incentive to enhance participation. In this context, the information exchanged would achieve a real transactional value and present a new electronic commerce paradigm. Overall, such exchange could also be seen as a serious game.},

Aggregating immense amounts of data feeds from different networks is not necessarily sufficient for providing a better understanding about the processes taking place in the city.

abstract = {The dynamics of social events happening in large metropolitan areas are extremely complex. Location-based user generated data could be an exceptionally rich source of informa- tion about events, however the vastness and the heterogeneity of such information makes it almost impossible for city managers to have a comprehensive view. Some events are planned and advertised only among restricted communities, for many it is problematic to estimate the number of attendees, and in general it is very difficult to have information about citizen mobility in areas nearby or where events happen. In this paper, we describe EXSED, an interactive intelligent tool to support the visual exploration of social events dynamics along the spatial, temporal and organizational dimensions. Major functionalities include: (i) studying events that are either officially/unofficially planned and with global/local scope; (ii) extract discussion topics for an event and investigate their temporal and spatial profile; (iii) estimate event attendees and correlate their mobility patterns with the event evolution. We present preliminary results of a field study with officials from Dublin City Council (Ireland), who evaluated our tool on real world user-generated tweeter data and events in the city.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Advanced data analytics have become an integral part of a number of eScience initiatives including the many challenges facing the urban sciences. Understanding the movement of people and their spatial trajectorits would greatly aid the development of policies for sustainable urban living including urban traffic analysis and smart city management. Due to the widespread popularity of mobile devices with location-aware capabilities and the extensive prevalence of location-based social networks, citizens' movements and their trajectories are being produced and gathered at an unprecedented rate. In this context, there are two fundamental issues that need to be addressed: trajectory data hold private information of citizens that require privacy preserving solutions for data release and analysis, and the heterogeneous nature of the trajectory data makes it hard to effectively measure their similarity, which is fundamental to trajectory analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing an innovative private trajectories calibration model that not only guarantees the privacy of citizens, but also increases the utility. We have conducted comprehensive experiments using real-life user trajectories extracted from Twitter data. The results reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, which is also reported in this paper.},

abstract = {Capacity planning is a key challenge for long-distance coach vendors due to the competitive market pressure. Travel-intensive events have the potential to increase the capacities for existing routes or to offer new connections. Actually, planning activities of vendors are mainly based on past-data. To improve the quality of predictions about future capacities, information from different data sources e.g. social media, geo-based information or websites has to be considered. Technologies to collect structured and unstructured information from different data sources are available. This paper presents an approach to use these technologies for capacity predictions and pricing of coach vendors in terms of travel-intensive events. To verify the approach, a case study, focused on the UEFA EURO 2016, is described. The case study is necessary to demonstrate the value of the research and to give a deeper understanding about data sources and the discussion culture of travelers in social networks.},
