abstract = {While the classic definition of Big Data included the dimensions volume, velocity, and variety, a fourth dimension, veracity, has recently come to the attention of researchers and practitioners. The increasing amount of user-generated data associated with the rise of social media emphasizes the need for methods to deal with the uncertainty inherent to these data sources. In this paper we address one aspect of uncertainty by developing a new methodology to establish the reliability of user-generated data based upon causal links with recurring patterns. We associate a large data set of geo-tagged Twitter messages in San Francisco with points of interest, such as bars, restaurants, or museums, within the city. This model is validated by causal relationships between a point of interest and the amount of messages in its vicinity. We subsequently analyze the behavior of these messages over time using a jackknifing procedure to identify categories of points of interest that exhibit consistent patterns over time. Ultimately, we condense this analysis into an indicator that gives evidence on the certainty of a data set based on these causal relationships and recurring patterns in temporal and spatial dimensions.},

abstract = {Ride-sharing systems should combine environmental protection (through a reduction of fossil fuel usage), socialization, and security. Encouraging people to use ride-sharing systems by satisfying their demands for safety, privacy and convenience is challenging. Most previous works on this topic have focused on finding a fixed path between the driver and the riders either based solely on their locations or using social information. The drivers' and riders' lack of options to change or compute the path according to their own preferences and requirements is problematic. With the advancement of mobile social networking technologies, it is necessary to reconsider the principles and desired characteristics of ride-sharing systems. In this paper, we formalized the ride-sharing problem as a multi source-destination path planning problem. An objective function that models different objectives in a unified framework was developed. Moreover, we provide a similarity model, which can reflect the personal preferences of the rides and utilize social media to obtain the current interests of the riders and drivers. The model also allows each driver to generate sub-optimal paths according to his own requirements by suitably adjusting the weights. Two case studies have shown that our system has the potential to find the best possible match and computes the multiple optimal paths against different user-defined objective functions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Fueled by unprecedented economic growth, Beijing, China, has been under-going rapid urbanization and motorization over the last 30 years. Like other big cities, Beijing has struggled with traffic congestion problems for a long time. The first part of this paper introduces urban development patterns of Beijing. It then carefully reviews Beijing's historical and recent congestion mitigation measures, highlighting the unique characteristics of each of the city's development stage. However, as historic records show, mere infrastructure expansion does not ease congestion. Scien-tific and comprehensive travel demand management (TDM) measures are required. Although many achievements have been made in the course of implementing com-prehensive measures, several problems have affected the whole development situation of urban public transportation in Beijing, such as uncoordinated transportation and urban development, low-quality public transportation services, weak TDM measures, and shrinking green travel. Finally, recently issued guidance policies are introduced for future transportation management in fields like public transportation development, private vehicle control, and non-motorized transportation promotion. This paper con-cludes with Beijing's experience in developing transportation systems and offers advice to draft the city's future development strategy, which also inspires other mega cities that are undergoing rapid urbanization as well.},

abstract = {This article discusses the background, nature and application of the concept of ubiquitous city, presenting u-city initiatives of affluent and techno-savvy cities in Asia and the West with special reference to the case of South Korea. The focus is on how ubiquitous technologies have been and can be utilised in developing urban infrastructure, including town planning, street and property maintenance, water supply, public transportation and environmental protection. Such an emerging infrastructure is expected to provide everyone with an opportunity to access urban infrastructure and services with the help of ubiquitous technologies. However, in order to become reality, this requires some kind of democratisation of technology, which is a neglected topic in u-city discourse. It is also important to analyse u-city developments from the point of view of production of space with special reference to the potential colonisation of everyday life. Theoretically speaking, one answer to such compelling questions about the rationale of u-city development can be sought from the idea of the ‘right to the city', a slogan originally coined by Henri Lefebvre. This approach highlights the importance of involving people to envisioning the future of urban form starting from the perspective of their everyday life. Such a dimension should be given more prominent role in current u-city developments.},

Crowdsourcing in local governments could be defined as the use of new technologies in order to take advantage of citizen knowledge to find solutions to municipal problems. This paper analyzes two experiences of crowdsourcing at local level, and the opinions of the citizens and managers involved, to provide an initial assessment of its effectiveness and suggest avenues for improvement. Engaging citizens in e-participation initiatives is a challenge but, for public sector crowdsourcing initiatives, intrinsic motivation and intangible rewards seem to be enough to motivate participants. Results show that managers find citizens' propositions viable, but publishing the final results and indicating how the ideas selected will be further developed are pending tasks. Caution is needed as failure to deliver the benefits deemed essential by citizens can make them even more reluctant to engage. {\textcopyright} 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

Sometimes it is beneficial, however, to include more information than in a simple graph of only nodes and links. Adding information about times of interactions can make predictions and mechanistic understanding more accurate. The drawback, however, is that there are not so many methods available, partly because temporal networks is a relatively young field, partly because it more difficult to develop such methods compared to for static networks. In this colloquium, we review the methods to analyze and model temporal networks and processes taking place on them, focusing mainly on the last three years. This includes the spreading of infectious disease, opinions, rumors, in social networks; information packets in computer networks; various types of signaling in biology, and more.

abstract = {The FuturICT project seeks to use the power of big data, analytic models grounded in complexity science, and the collective intelligence they yield for societal benefit. Accordingly, this paper argues that these new tools should not remain the preserve of restricted government, scientific or corporate {\'{e}}lites, but be opened up for societal engagement and critique. To democratise such assets as a public good, requires a sustainable ecosystem enabling different kinds of stakeholder in society, including but not limited to, citizens and advocacy groups, school and university students, policy analysts, scientists, software developers, journalists and politicians. Our working name for envisioning a sociotechnical infrastructure capable of engaging such a wide constituency is the Global Participatory Platform (GPP). We consider what it means to develop a GPP at the different levels of data, models and deliberation, motivating a framework for different stakeholders to find their ecological niches at different levels within the system, serving the functions of (i) sensing the environment in order to pool data, (ii) mining the resulting data for patterns in order to model the past/present/future, and (iii) sharing and contesting possible interpretations of what those models might mean, and in a policy context, possible decisions. A research objective is also to apply the concepts and tools of complexity science and social science to the project's own work. We therefore conceive the global participatory platform as a resilient, epistemic ecosystem, whose design will make it capable of self-organization and adaptation to a dynamic environment, and whose structure and contributions are themselves networks of stakeholders, challenges, issues, ideas and arguments whose structure and dynamics can be modelled and analysed.},

abstract = {Here we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.},

Yet, we do not understand the princi- ples underlying our strongly connected, techno-socio-economic systems. We have enabled ubiquitous Internet connectivity and instant, global information access. Yet we do not understand how it impacts our be- havior and the evolution of society. To fill the knowledge gaps and keep up with the fast pace at which our world is changing, a Knowledge Accelerator must urgently be cre- ated. The financial crisis, international wars, global terror, the spread- ing of diseases and cyber-crime as well as demographic, technological and environmental change demonstrate that humanity is facing seri- ous challenges. These problems cannot be solved within the traditional paradigms. Moving our attention from a component-oriented view of the world to an interaction-oriented view will allow us to understand the com- plex systems we have created and the emergent collective phenomena characterising them. This paradigm shift will enable new solutions to long-standing problems, very much as the shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric worldview has facilitated modern physics and the ability to launch satellites. The FuturICT flagship project will develop new science and technology to manage our future in a complex, strongly connected world. For this, it will combine the power of information and communication technol- ogy (ICT) with knowledge from the social and complexity sciences. ICT will provide the data to boost the social sciences into a new era. Complexity science will shed new light on the emergent phenomena in socially interactive systems, and the social sciences will provide a better understanding of the opportunities and risks of strongly net- worked systems, in particular future ICT systems. Hence, the envisaged FuturICT flagship will create new methods and instruments to tackle the challenges of the 21st century. FuturICT could indeed become one of the most important scientific endeavours ever, by revealing the principles that make socially inter- active systems work well, by inspiring the creation of new platforms to explore our possible futures, and by initiating an era of social and socio-inspired innovations.},

On the one hand, an ‘excessive' influx of migration is managed through violent means by the state and the para-state; on the other, a ‘scarcity' of domestic resources is blamed for a ‘rise' in racist attitudes, and the political ascent of a fascist movement-cum-parliamentary party, Χ$\rho$$\upsilon$$\sigma$ή Α$\upsilon$$\gamma$ή (Golden Dawn). ‘Crisis' is said to give rise to ‘austerity'—and hostility. Inverting the inverted causal relationship between crisis, austerity and hostility, I problematise representa- tions of hostility towards migrants that construct racism as a consequence of economic conditions or even as the antidote to the ‘bitter pill' Greeks have been forced to swallow. I examine how racialised and gendered violence secures the politics of austerity in Greece focusing on three eruptions of violence (the feminicidal acid attack on Konstantina Kouneva, the murder of Shehzad Luqman and the drowning of eleven refugees near the island of Farmakonisi). I draw concrete connections between the politics of austerity and what, drawing on Sara Ahmed, might be termed an ‘affective economy of hostility' that articulates racialised and gendered modes of belonging and estrangement. Some bodies are rendered vulnerable and precarious, while others assert an entitled relation to national space while being economically disentitled by austerity measures.},

This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city.

abstract = {Big data technologies and a range of Gov- ernment open data initiatives provide the basis for discovering new insights into cities; how they are planned, how they managed and the day-to-day chal- lenges they face in health, transport and changing population profiles. The Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN – www.aurin.org.au) project is one example of such a big data initiative that is currently running across Australia. AURIN provides a single gateway providing online (live) pro- grammatic access to over 2000 data sets from over 70 major and typically definitive data-driven organi- zations across federal and State government, across industry and across academia. However whilst open (public) data is useful to bring data-driven intelligence to cities, more often than not, it is the data that is not-publicly accessible that is essential to understand city challenges and needs. Such sensitive (unit-level) data has unique requirements on access and usage to meet the privacy and confidentiality demands of the associated organizations. In this paper we highlight a novel geo-privacy supporting solution implemented as part of the AURIN project that provides seamless and secure access to individual (unit-level) data from the Department of Health in Victoria. We illus- trate this solution across a range of typical city chal- lenges in localized contexts around Melbourne. We show how unit level data can be combined with other data in a privacy-protecting manner. Unlike other secure data access and usage solutions that have been developed/deployed, the AURIN solution allows any researcher to access and use the data in a manner that meets all of the associated privacy and confidential- ity concerns, without obliging them to obtain ethical approval or any other hurdles that are normally put in place on access to and use of sensitive data. This provides a paradigm shift in secure access to sensitive data with geospatial content.},

abstract = {This article explores the role of informal governance and institutions in the self-settlement strategies of Somalis in South Africa. Based on 3 years of ethnographic fieldwork with Somalis in Johannesburg, this article argues that informal governance operated though kin, clan and social networks, and personal, localised relationship with state authorities and community leaders are instrumental in governing settlement. Moreover, this form of governance is located within the multiple systems of Somali social order.},

@article{Capra2012,
abstract = {Social computing broadly refers to supporting so- cial behaviours using computational systems. In the last decade, the advent of Web 2.0 and its social networking services, wikis, blogs, and social bookmarking has revo- lutionised social computing, creating new online contexts within which people interact socially (social networking). With the pervasiveness of mobile devices and embedded sensors, we stand at the brink of another major revolution, where the boundary between online and offline social be- haviours blurs, providing opportunities for (re)defining so- cial conventions and contexts once again. But opportunities come with challenges: can middleware foster the engineer- ing of social software?We identify three societal grand chal- lenges that are likely to drive future research in social com- puting and elaborate on howthe middleware community can help address them.},

@article{Franke2015,
abstract = {We describe a platform for smart, city-wide crowd management based on participatory mobile phone sensing and location/situation specific information delivery. The platform supports quick and flexible deployments of end-to-end applications for specific events or spaces that include four key functionalities: (1) Mobile phone based delivery of event/space specific information to the users, (2) participatory sensor data collection (from app users) and flexible analysis, (3) location and situation specific message multicast instructing people in different areas to act differently in case of an emergency and (4) post mortem event analysis. This paper describes the requirements that were derived through a series of test deployments, the system architecture, the implementation and the experiences made during real life, large scale deployments. Thus, until today it has been deployed at 14 events in three European countries (UK, Netherlands, Switzerland) and was used by well over 100,000 people.},

@article{VanOort2015,
abstract = {Due to reduced budgets, higher political expectations and increasing competition between operators, there is growing pressure on public transport companies and authorities to improve their operational efficiency. It is thus of utter importance for them to be able to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks and potentials in their public transport service. Recorded operational data, which has quickly become more widespread in the last decade, aids greatly in this process and enables operators and authorities to continually improve. In this paper we identify some of the arising possibilities. We first describe the state of publicly available transit data, with an emphasis on the Dutch situation. Next, the value of insights from Automatic Vehicle Location data is demonstrated by examples. Thereafter, a software tool is presented that enables operators and authorities to quickly perform comprehensive operational analyses, and which was able to identify several bottlenecks when applied in practice.},

@article{Coggin2012,
abstract = {In a rapidly urbanising society and against a background of rural under-development, cities are increasingly the locations for access to basic socio-economic amenities and essential services.Access to the city and everything that it offers therefore impacts profoundly on the manner and extent to which poor and marginalised persons access the objects of their constitutionally ensconced socio-economic rights.Conversely, the content of the ‘right to the city' is impacted by legal understandings of the ambit, scope and enforceability of socio-economic rights. Either way, the South African Constitution's entrenchment of rights to access water, housing, health care services and education, alongside its guarantee of a substantive right to equality, mean that urban design, policy making and regeneration processes have become increasingly legalized and will increasingly be tested for constitutional compliance, especially in instances where they have the effect of excluding poor and marginalised persons from the city. This article begins to unpack the interrelationship between constitutional rights and the right to the city, focusing specifically on the impact of rights-based litigation and judgements on urban policy making, design and regeneration in South Africa.},
