abstract = {While the classic definition of Big Data included the dimensions volume, velocity, and variety, a fourth dimension, veracity, has recently come to the attention of researchers and practitioners. The increasing amount of user-generated data associated with the rise of social media emphasizes the need for methods to deal with the uncertainty inherent to these data sources. In this paper we address one aspect of uncertainty by developing a new methodology to establish the reliability of user-generated data based upon causal links with recurring patterns. We associate a large data set of geo-tagged Twitter messages in San Francisco with points of interest, such as bars, restaurants, or museums, within the city. This model is validated by causal relationships between a point of interest and the amount of messages in its vicinity. We subsequently analyze the behavior of these messages over time using a jackknifing procedure to identify categories of points of interest that exhibit consistent patterns over time. Ultimately, we condense this analysis into an indicator that gives evidence on the certainty of a data set based on these causal relationships and recurring patterns in temporal and spatial dimensions.},

abstract = {Ride-sharing systems should combine environmental protection (through a reduction of fossil fuel usage), socialization, and security. Encouraging people to use ride-sharing systems by satisfying their demands for safety, privacy and convenience is challenging. Most previous works on this topic have focused on finding a fixed path between the driver and the riders either based solely on their locations or using social information. The drivers' and riders' lack of options to change or compute the path according to their own preferences and requirements is problematic. With the advancement of mobile social networking technologies, it is necessary to reconsider the principles and desired characteristics of ride-sharing systems. In this paper, we formalized the ride-sharing problem as a multi source-destination path planning problem. An objective function that models different objectives in a unified framework was developed. Moreover, we provide a similarity model, which can reflect the personal preferences of the rides and utilize social media to obtain the current interests of the riders and drivers. The model also allows each driver to generate sub-optimal paths according to his own requirements by suitably adjusting the weights. Two case studies have shown that our system has the potential to find the best possible match and computes the multiple optimal paths against different user-defined objective functions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Detection of events using voluntarily generated content in microblogs has been the objective of numerous recent studies. One essential challenge tackled in these studies is estimating the locations of events. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art location estimation techniques used in the localization of events detected in microblogs, particularly in Twitter, which is one of themost popular microblogging platformsworldwide.We analyze these techniques with respect to the targeted event type, granularity of estimated locations, location-related features selected as sources of spatial evidence, and the method used to make aggregate decisions based on the extracted evidence. We discuss the strengths and advantages of alternative solutions to various problems related to location estimation, as well as their preconditions and limitations.We examine themost widely used evaluationmethods to analyze the accuracy of estimations and present the results reported in the literature.We also discuss our findings and highlight important research challenges that may need further attention.},

abstract = {Fueled by unprecedented economic growth, Beijing, China, has been under-going rapid urbanization and motorization over the last 30 years. Like other big cities, Beijing has struggled with traffic congestion problems for a long time. The first part of this paper introduces urban development patterns of Beijing. It then carefully reviews Beijing's historical and recent congestion mitigation measures, highlighting the unique characteristics of each of the city's development stage. However, as historic records show, mere infrastructure expansion does not ease congestion. Scien-tific and comprehensive travel demand management (TDM) measures are required. Although many achievements have been made in the course of implementing com-prehensive measures, several problems have affected the whole development situation of urban public transportation in Beijing, such as uncoordinated transportation and urban development, low-quality public transportation services, weak TDM measures, and shrinking green travel. Finally, recently issued guidance policies are introduced for future transportation management in fields like public transportation development, private vehicle control, and non-motorized transportation promotion. This paper con-cludes with Beijing's experience in developing transportation systems and offers advice to draft the city's future development strategy, which also inspires other mega cities that are undergoing rapid urbanization as well.},
